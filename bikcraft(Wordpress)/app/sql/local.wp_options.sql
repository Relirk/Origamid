As WordPress powers more than 33% of websites, people from across the world use it in their daily life. That means there is a lot that needs translating, and into many different languages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 11 May 2019, from 00:00 UTC until 23:59 UTC, <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation Day</a> aims to celebrate the thousands of volunteers who contribute to translation and internalization. The event is also an opportunity for encouraging more people to get involved and help increase the availability of themes and plugins in different languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;At the time of the last event in 2017, WordPress was being translated into 178 languages, we have now reached the 200 mark!&#8221;</p><cite>WPtranslationday.org</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What happens on WordPress Translation Day?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/the-local-events/\">local meetings all over the world</a>, as well as online talks by people from the WordPress community.

These are streamed in multiple languages</li><li><strong>Localization sessions</strong>: General instruction and specifics for particular areas and languages. These sessions are streamed in multiple languages.</li><li><strong>Internalization sessions</strong>: Tutorials about optimizing the code to ease localization processes, also called <em>internationalization</em> or i18n. These sessions are streamed in English.</li><li><strong>Local events</strong>: Polyglot contributors will gather around the world for socializing, discussing, and translating together.</li><li><strong>Remote events</strong>: Translation teams that cannot gather physically, will connect remotely. They will be available for training, mentoring, and supporting new contributors. They will also engage in &#8220;translating marathons&#8221;, in which existing teams translate as many strings as they can!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of experienced WordPress translators and internationalization experts are part of the line-up for the livestream, joined by some first time contributors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have or haven&#8217;t contributed to the Polyglots before, you can join in for WordPress Translation Day.

This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/\">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">detailed documentation is available</a>.

This release will include some great new features, along with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">the latest updates to the block editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most anticipated new features is the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/\">improved fatal error detection</a> &#8211; this was removed from v5.1 shortly before release so that it could be improved and made more secure for this release. Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/minimum-php-version-update/\">PHP 5.6 is going to become the minimum required PHP version for WordPress</a>, a significant step towards a more modern web and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/26/coding-standards-updates-for-php-5-6/\">updated coding standards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/wordpress-5-2-beta-1/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in beta</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

In an effort to make it easier for content creators to find these block types, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/\">there is a proposal</a> for a new type of plugin and a directory to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal outlines a new type of WordPress plugin that provides blocks and nothing else, named Single Block Plugins. The primary benefit would be to provide content creators with individual pieces of functionality and new types of blocks without the need to search for and install new plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Single Block Plugins would be hosted in a separate Block Directory section of the Plugin Directory and they would initially be JavaScript-based. Each plugin will register a single block, and they will be searchable and installable from within the editor itself. This puts blocks at the publishers’ fingertips &#8212; you no longer have to leave the editor to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in shaping this new type of plugin?

The block editor now supports your browser&#8217;s reduced motion settings. The post URL slug has better labelling and help text. The focus styling for keyboard navigating through landmarks is clearer and more consistent. There are a variety of new speak messages, and existing messages have been tweaked for more useful screen-reader behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added several new blocks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An RSS block</li><li>An Amazon Kindle embed block</li><li>A Search block</li><li>A Calendar block</li><li>A Tag Cloud block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you keep track of these blocks, and only show the ones you need, there&#8217;s a new block management tool to switch blocks on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6806\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" /><figcaption>Block Management Modal</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re constantly working on existing blocks, too.

Brazilian developer Diego Haz launched his MIT-licensed open source project this week with a stable version 1.0 now available to the public.</p>\n<p>The toolkit offers offers composable, themeable, and accessible UI components that strictly follow <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WAI-ARIA 1.1</a> standards. Out of the box, Reakit manages focus and keyboard interactions for components that require them. </p>\n<p>&#8220;WAI-ARIA is hard,&#8221; Haz said. &#8220;Mostly because the spec is dense, confusing and incomplete. My goal with Reakit is not only to provide accessible components out of the box, but also to serve as an example so people can build their own accessible stuff from scratch.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A year ago I left my job to dedicate myself to this open source project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png\" alt=\"🎉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Announcing Reakit v1 <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png\" alt=\"🎉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f449.png\" alt=\"👉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/GbaNYa5rck\">https://t.co/GbaNYa5rck</a></p>\n<p>This is the best project I’ve ever done in my 17 years of programming.

The core library is now unstyled by default and does not depend a CSS library. This makes it easier for developers to build UIs from scratch. Developers with specific presentational requirements can easily apply their own styles, instead of spending time having to overwrite a built-in set of styles.</p>\n<p>Those who don&#8217;t want to start from scratch can install a theme package like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/reakit-theme-default\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reakit-theme-default</a>.

Since I had savings, I decided to focus on this project. But soon enough I&#8217;ll have to find another job. I&#8217;ll try to find companies where I can use Reakit so I can improve the library at the same time I&#8217;m building something with it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Not all companies prioritize accessibility in their React-based products. One reason is the expertise and passion for accessibility, paired with React skills, is hard to find.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit-finds-significant-and-pervasive-accessibility-problems\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPCampus&#8217; Gutenberg accessibility audit</a> demonstrated, making accessible web apps with React is challenging. Gutenberg is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-may/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">making major improvements towards becoming more accessible</a> after the completion of the audit. This process has shown that leveraging accessibility expertise and baking it in from the beginning is crucial for writing accessible web apps. </p>\n<p>React is often, and perhaps unfairly, singled out as <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/02/25/accessibility-is-not-a-react-problem/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">having an accessibility problem</a>. The library isn&#8217;t known for making it easy, but it does provide <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">accessibility documentation</a> and encourages developers to write semantic HTML. </p>\n<p>While there is no magical &#8220;do-it-for-me&#8221; library that can ensure an app&#8217;s accessibility, the Reakit toolkit gives developers a head start.

There weren’t video games either, until I was in junior high school and Pong came out. Back when I was a kid, girls mostly thought about becoming teachers, nurses, ballerinas, and mothers. We weren’t encouraged to do “man” jobs. We definitely weren’t encouraged to pursue STEM careers.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, my high school guidance counselor told me that I should give up my dream of college and concentrate on being a stay-at-home mom. (It was 1987 and I was ranked 21/325 students in my graduating class.)</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a bit of a calculated rebel, so I didn’t heed her advice. Instead I started down a long path through academia that would eventually bring me here, to WordPress and the community that has become my tribe.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m often asked how I started my WordPress business. I would love to tell you a story about how I did a ton of research, met with mentors, found advisors, wrote a perfect business plan, crafted an amazing marketing plan, and launched according to a timeline all neatly written out (and using a project management app, of course).</p>\n<h3>It wasn&#8217;t like that at all.</h3>\n<p>At the time I started my business I had worked in higher education for over twenty years as an administrator in five different colleges, universities, and trade schools. I had a bachelor of arts degree in Religion and Philosophy, classical training in vocal performance, an MBA (in marketing, e-commerce, and information systems management), and coursework completed toward a doctorate in higher education administration.</p>\n<p>In June of 2013, I decided it was time to leave my job as an administrator in a local trade school. I hadn&#8217;t really been happy for a long while, and the timing was right financially for me to make a move. My plan was to take July off, use August to job search, then be employed by September.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Have you ever heard the phrase, &#8220;Men plan, God laughs&#8221;?</p></blockquote>\n<p>While it was still June, and within the two weeks’ notice I had given, I was afraid I might become bored. I thought I could make a little money doing some marketing, so I posted to my personal Facebook page that I would love to help out friends and family with social media or web design. The customers came out of the woodwork.</p>\n<h3>And just like that, I had a business.</h3>\n<p>I made many mistakes along the way, of course. I charged $300 for a website when I started ($500 for e-commerce). I paid my dues and learned the trade. I started attending WordPress meetups in Rochester. They were sporadic, at best, so when the organizer asked me if I would become the organizer, I jumped at the chance and got us on a regular schedule, with topics in advance and volunteer speakers.</p>\n<p>From there it was just a matter of time before I would attend my first WordCamp (Buffalo, 2014). Since then I’ve attended more than thirty camps, organized six, mentored five, and spoken at twenty.</p>\n<h3>I love WordPress. But I love the people even more.</h3>\n<p>I don’t just <em>love</em> WordPress. I <em>fell in love</em> with WordPress. The ease of use. The total control. I love that there’s always more to learn. I love that I can teach others how to use it. I love the events. I love the collaboration. I love the people.</p>\n<p>I don’t just have WordPress acquaintances. I have WordPress friends. I have a WordPress <em>family</em>.</p>\n<p>The first site I ever logged into was created for my best friend and me. We had just started a nonprofit organization and her husband built us a website. He made the structure, but we had to add the content. He emailed us our logins. I remember logging in like I had mistakenly been given the key to the castle and wasn’t really supposed to use it. I was afraid to click links. I was afraid to click “publish” or “update.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought for sure I’d kill the whole site. But I didn’t.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I wrote. I added classes. I added pages. I added posts. We added a membership component and soon I was navigating that like a sailor in well-known waters. I was a great WordPress user, but I still didn’t understand the connection between purchasing a domain and having a WordPress site, so I called my friend’s husband.</p>\n<p>Rob and Christine had five kids and Christine worked evenings. When I asked Rob to teach me how to get from the domain purchase to having a site, a deal was struck: if I would cook dinner for their kids, he would teach me WordPress. I made spaghetti, purchased a domain and hosting, and I wrote 4 things down on a piece of paper:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download WordPress from wordpress.org.</li>\n<li>Upload WordPress through FTP.</li>\n<li>Edit wp-config file (don’t forget to change the salt keys)</li>\n<li>Don’t use “admin” as the account name.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The rest I (miraculously) remembered. That was eight years and over 300 WordPress installations ago.</p>\n<h3>Which all led me to where I am now.</h3>\n<p>Getting up the courage to speak at WordCamp about a year after I started building sites was scary. I felt like an imposter. I was sure I would be “found out,” but I really did “know my stuff.” People were very complimentary about my talk, so I applied to more camps. I met more people. My friends teased me that I wanted to know all the “A-Listers” in WordPress. Others teased that I wanted to BE an A-Lister. What I really wanted was to learn as much as I could, share what I knew, and build a network.</p>\n<p>In 2017 I spoke at WordCamp Ottawa. It was there I built a connection with Jason Knill of GiveWP.com. I had used Give before, and I told him about how it worked for me. He asked if Give could write about the nonprofit site I had built to raise money to feed children in South Sudan. He interviewed me about it. At the end of our meeting I mentioned to Jason that “if you ever have an opening, I’d love to work for you.” Four and a half months later I started working full-time as the Head of Customer Success for Give.</p>\n<h3>What I love about my job.</h3>\n<p>In my role at Give I get to talk to people all over the world. I get to help them increase their fundraising, which in turn helps their organizations &#8211; most of which are nonprofits helping make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>With our WP Business Reviews plugin I get to work with businesses that are hoping to grow and succeed &#8211; just like I did when I started my freelance business.</p>\n<p>I get to build a team that helps us succeed by helping others succeed. I get to employ people locally in my small hometown outside of Rochester, NY.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I get to keep sharing my love of WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I continue to speak at WordCamps, mentor and teach locally, and organize my local WordPress Meetup and Technology Nonprofit Meetup. I love Slack, Facebook Groups, Facebook Messenger, and Twitter messages because they let me keep in touch with all of the wonderful people I meet in the community.</p>\n<h3>Mostly I love how WordPress has empowered me to do more and to be more.</h3>\n<p>I’ve spent most of my life trying to broaden my comfort zone.</p>\n<p>As you can probably tell, I have a pretty large comfort zone. Actually, I can’t remember the last time I saw the border of my comfort zone, because it’s that big; but it wasn’t always so. When I was a child I had a comfort zone the size of a postage stamp. I had to stand in it on one toe, like an uncoordinated ballerina trying to learn to go en pointe and failing miserably. I was timid and shy. I was afraid of everything.</p>\n<p>Then one day I decided to do something uncomfortable. I ran for 8th grade student council secretary. It didn’t occur to me that I might not win. I have no idea where that hubris came from. I figured, at that point, that I had just as good a chance as anybody else. I made posters. I gave a speech. And something amazing happened. <em><strong>I lost the election.</strong></em> I mean, I cataclysmically lost the election.</p>\n<p>Most people wouldn’t think that losing an election was amazing, but it was. It was amazing because I learned that I could step outside of my comfort zone, lose, and survive. I could still breathe. Still be me. It had changed me and my perceptions of myself. After that, instead of a postage stamp-sized comfort zone, I could put my foot down on the whole envelope.</p>\n<h3>It didn’t end there.</h3>\n<p>What I learned is that comfort zones are like concentric circles. A step outside doesn’t just stretch the zone to fit that footstep. Instead, it increases it exponentially. Where before you had a three-foot circle, now you have a six-foot circle, then twelve feet, then twenty-four feet, then before you know it, you won’t be able to see the edge of your zone because it’s so big.</p>\n<h3>WordPress helped me with that, too.</h3>\n<p>Instead of feeling like an imposter, the WordPress community embraced me and gave me the validation I needed to feel like I belonged. People were receptive to my ideas. Some wanted to teach me. Some wanted to learn from me. Some wanted to work with me. People hired me. Others asked my opinion or for help. I belonged. <em>I had a tribe.</em></p>\n<p>I will continue to contribute to, support, learn from and grow with WordPress. I love it here. I love my tribe.</p>\n<h3>I hope you find your tribe, too.</h3>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: I Found My Tribe\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=I%20Found%20My%20Tribe&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-found-my-tribe%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: I Found My Tribe\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-found-my-tribe%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-found-my-tribe%2F&title=I+Found+My+Tribe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: I Found My Tribe\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/i-found-my-tribe/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/051519-min-150x150.jpg&description=I Found My Tribe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: I Found My Tribe\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-found-my-tribe/\" title=\"I Found My Tribe\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-found-my-tribe/\">I Found My Tribe</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 May 2019 12:00:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Michelle Ames\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 352 – Capital P Dangit and My Future Plans\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89665&preview=true&preview_id=89665\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-352-capital-p-dangit-and-my-future-plans\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2605:\"<p><strong>*Update*</strong> The previous mp3 attached to this post inadvertently ended around the 31 minute mark.

Bear features a zen writing experience blended seamlessly with note-taking capabilities, a combination that landed the app an Apple Design Award in 2017.</p>\n<p>People use Bear for everything from taking notes to writing chapters for books. Many users also rely on the app for writing drafts for blogs they plan to publish on other platforms. This often requires multiple steps for copying and pasting content, especially when there is media or HTML included in the content.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, the app&#8217;s creators had WordPress publishing on their to-do list but it wasn&#8217;t yet a priority. They were reluctant to implement their own publishing tool with the WordPress APIs and preferred a solution that would rely on external apps. </p>\n<p>Things have changed in the past couple of years, as writing apps have more pressure to provide a frictionless connection to publishing capabilities in order to remain competitive. WordPress&#8217; market share has grown to be an estimated <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33% of the the top 10 million websites</a>. In fact, Bear recently <a href=\"https://blog.bear.app/2019/02/our-blog-has-a-new-home-and-some-new-perks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">moved its blog off of Medium and over to WordPress</a> in February 2019. </p>\n<p>This week WordPress.com, maintainers of the open source WordPress mobile apps, and Bear <a href=\"https://blog.bear.app/2019/05/introducing-a-new-way-to-publish-bear-notes-to-wordpress-on-ipad-and-iphone/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that they have collaborated on a solution that allows users to publish notes to WordPress blogs on iOS. Recent updates to both Bear and WordPress apps enable users to click the share icon on a note and see WordPress pop up as an option. The content is shared with all of its formatting, headings, lists, links, and media in tact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/ciCXTmNNLfv\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/cldup.com/u5KnyhPiCg.gif?resize=400%2C710&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bear screen recording\" width=\"400\" height=\"710\" /></a></p>\n<p>The developers at Shiny Frog, makers of the Bear app, explained the solution they landed on for the WordPress integration:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We built an <a href=\"https://github.com/shinyfrog/TextBundle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open source library</a> for processing TextBundle files. <a href=\"http://textbundle.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TextBundle</a> is an open standard for sharing plain text files that include attachments like photos. WordPress then worked to add TextBundle support to its iOS app. Bear hands your note off to WordPress as a TextBundle file, and WordPress converts it into a blog post.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Using an open standard like this allows other other developers to <a href=\"https://github.com/shinyfrog/TextBundle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">build on top of it</a> to create their own integrations for other platforms.

Currently, there are over 7000 themes in the directory, the most popular of which exceeds <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/oceanwp/\">300,000 active installations</a>. (Not including Twenty____ Themes which are packaged with WordPress and have install counts in the millions.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before submitting your theme to the directory, it’s important to understand the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/\">review process</a> first because if your theme doesn’t meet those requirements it can be rejected on the spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Themes that have 3 or more distinct issues may be closed as not-approved. However, theme authors may resubmit the theme once they’ve corrected the issues.</p><cite><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/\">https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviewers are on your side and want to see your theme go live, once it meets the standards required. If your theme has only minor issues preventing it being included in the directory, your reviewer will work with you to fix those. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if your theme has too many issues it will be closed as not-approved. If you decide to fix the issues you can upload the theme again &#8211; but it will join the back of the queue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From my experience <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&status=approved&owner=DannyCooper&col=id&col=summary&col=reporter&col=status&col=resolution&col=time&col=changetime&order=owner&desc=1&report=12\">reviewing over 100 themes</a> I’ve been able to identify the most common issues that prevent themes being approved. By sharing these with you in this article I’m hoping I can help you avoid getting stuck in the queue or rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Uploading Your Theme</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you upload a theme, it joins the queue to be reviewed. On average it will take two months for your theme to reach the front of the queue and receive its first review. All reviewers are volunteers with limited time available to complete reviews. A variety of factors can affect the wait time. When more people volunteer to review themes, the queue moves quickly. Conversely, when themes with a lot of issues are submitted it slows down the queue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By submitting a theme that meets all the requirements it makes the review process a lot smoother and ultimately your theme will be live sooner. In this guide, we are going to explore the most common issues that will keep your theme held up in the queue and prevent it from being approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: Theme authors that have a track record of submitting issue-free themes can apply to become &#8216;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-launches-trusted-authors-program\">Trusted Authors</a>&#8216;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Naming Issues</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you upload a theme, the first check that is performed is to see if the name is already taken. Frequently you will be told the name you&#8217;ve chosen is already taken, even if you can&#8217;t see a theme with that name in the directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How could that be? The reason is that the test isn&#8217;t checking against just the directory, it&#8217;s checking against the entire WordPress ecosystem. If a theme has been released anywhere (Github, ThemeForest, etc.) and has over 50 active installations, that name will be unavailable to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: if you&#8217;ve released your theme elsewhere and accumulated 50+ installations, you can still use that name in the directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Unescaped Output</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme reviewers take security <strong>very</strong> seriously, there&#8217;s even a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/\">dedicated resource</a>. An entire article could be written on writing secure themes, but in this section we are going to explore one aspect: escaping output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unescaped output places users of your theme at risk. Here’s an example of an unescaped value ($title):</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">\n$title = get_option( \'my_custom_title\' );\necho \'&lt;h2&gt;\' . $title . \'&lt;/h2&gt;\';\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The problem with the above is that while we know what type of value $title <strong>should</strong> be, a string, we have not checked if that is the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a hacker has managed to change the value of &#8216;my_custom_title&#8217; in the database, your theme will output that value. This presents a huge risk as they could replace the intended output with inline Javascript:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">\n    alert(\'This is dangerous\'); \n\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The solution is to escape all output to ensure it only includes the type of data we are expecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our example could be fixed like this:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n$title = get_option( \'my_custom_title\' );\necho \'&lt;h2&gt;\' . esc_html( $title ) . \'&lt;/h2&gt;\';\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The downside to using esc_html is that it strips all HTML tags. If $title included bold or italics, for example:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n$title = \'This article is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; useful\';\necho esc_html( $title );\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The word &#8216;very&#8217; would not be bold on the frontend; instead it would output the code &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This illustrates why it&#8217;s important to use the correct escaping functions for the context. If we were expecting some HTML in the output, we&#8217;d be better using wp_kses_post() or wp_kses() and setting the $allowed_html parameter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Functions that output also need to be escaped:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">\n&lt;a href=\"&lt;?php echo esc_url( get_permalink() ); ?&gt;\"&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The exception is WordPress core functions that include &#8216;the_&#8217; in their name, these are usually escaped already.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\nfunction the_permalink( $post = 0 ) {\n    /**\n     * Filters the display of the permalink for the current post.\n     *\n     * @since 1.5.0\n     * @since 4.4.0 Added the `$post` parameter.\n     *\n     * @param string      $permalink The permalink for the current post.\n     * @param int|WP_Post $post      Post ID, WP_Post object, or 0. Default 0.\n     */\n    echo esc_url( apply_filters( \'the_permalink\', get_permalink( $post ), $post ) );\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3><strong>Untranslatable Text</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To be accepted into the directory all themes must be 100% &#8216;translation-ready&#8217;. That means each text string your theme outputs must be translatable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress already has the systems and functionality to handle the translation process, you just need to make sure your strings use the correct functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While simple to implement, this is often overlooked as it goes against the flow of how people write HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, you might do something like this:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n&lt;h1&gt;404 - Not Found&lt;/h1&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>To make it translatable, you need to add in some PHP:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n// __ functions are the basis of localization.\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php echo __( \'404\', \'text-domain\' ); ?&gt;\n\n// _e functions echo the value.\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php _e( \'404\', \'text-domain\' ); ?&gt;\n\n// Escape and echo the string.\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php esc_html_e( \'404\', \'text-domain\' ); ?&gt;\n\n// localization and variables.\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php _n( \'One post\', \'%s posts\', $count, \'text-domain\' ); ?&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>Strings output by functions must also be translation ready:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n// not translation-ready :-(\n&lt;?php next_posts_link( \'Older Entries\' ); ?&gt;\n\n// translation-ready :-)\n&lt;?php next_posts_link( esc_html__( \'Older Entries\', ‘text-domain’ ) ); ?&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>Tip: A lot of code examples in codex.wordpress.org don&#8217;t use the translation functions, so be careful when copy and pasting those.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Incorrectly Enqueuing Resources</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The .css and .js files your theme uses must be enqueued using the correct functions: wp_enqueue_style() for CSS and wp_enqueue_script() for Javascript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common error is to hardcode scripts and styles directly into the &lt;head&gt; or before &lt;/body&gt;. There are two problems to this approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Impossible to remove</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a plugin needs to remove a resource you have loaded, it’s not possible. If you had used the proper enqueue functions it could be done like so:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n/**\n * Dequeue the theme javascript.\n *\n * Hooked to the wp_enqueue_scripts action, with a late priority (100),\n * so that it is after the script was enqueued.\n */\nfunction wptavern_dequeue_script() {\n   wp_dequeue_script( \'theme-scripts\' );\n}\nadd_action( \'wp_enqueue_scripts\', \'wptavern_dequeue_script\', 100 );\n</pre>\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Duplicate Loading</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enqueue a resource, jQuery for example, and a plugin also enqueues it, WordPress is smart enough to only load it once.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n/**\n * Enqueue jQuery\n *\n * jQuery will only be loaded once, despite the two enqueues.\n * jQuery is packaged with WordPress so we don\'t need to specify a src. \n */\nfunction wptavern_enqueue_script() {\n   wp_enqueue_script( \'jquery\' );\n   wp_enqueue_script( \'jquery\' );\n}\nadd_action( \'wp_enqueue_scripts\', \'wptavern_enqueue_script\' );\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>If instead you had hardcoded jQuery into your &lt;head&gt; then there would be no way for WordPress to know, and it would be loaded twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Plugin-Territory Functionality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The scope of a theme should only handle the design and aesthetic of a website, all other functionality should be handled by WordPress itself or plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an attempt to add more value to their themes, theme authors often try to incorporate extra functionality, for example, SEO controls or custom post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with bundling functionality into a theme is that the data is not portable. Take SEO controls as an example, if the user changes the theme, they lose all the work they did to optimize their pages. In contrast by using an SEO plugin, the data and functionality is independent of the theme and will be retained when changing the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples of plugin-territory functionality:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Analytics/Tracking</li><li>SEO controls</li><li>Contact Forms</li><li>Shortcodes</li><li>Gutenberg Blocks</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Tip: If your code writes to the database, it is highly likely to be plugin territory. The exception would be design-related settings (sidebar position, colors, etc.).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Not Prefixing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Prefixing is a way of ensuring that your code doesn&#8217;t clash with code from plugins. Namespacing in PHP is a better way to achieve the same effect. However, some users are still using old versions of PHP (5.2) which don&#8217;t support that feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justin Tadlock shared a list of common things that should be prefixed:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>PHP function names.</li><li>PHP class names.</li><li>PHP global variables.</li><li>Action/Filter hooks.</li><li>Script handles.</li><li>Style handles.</li><li>Image size names.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://themereview.co/prefix-all-the-things/\">https://themereview.co/prefix-all-the-things/</a></p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n// function example.\nmy_prefix_example();\n\n// class example.\nclass My_Prefix_Example { … }\n\n// action and filter example.\ndo_action( \'my_prefix_action\' );\napply_filters( \'my_prefix_filter\', $values );\n\n// enqueue examples.\nwp_enqueue_script( \'my_prefix_script\', get_template_directory_uri() . \'/js/custom-script.js\' );\nwp_enqueue_style( \'my_prefix_style\', get_template_directory_uri() . \'/css/styles.css\' );\n\n// image size example.\nadd_image_size( \'my_prefix_image_size\', 220, 180 ); // 220 pixels wide by 180 pixels tall.\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>Exception: When enqueuing third-party resources, don’t add a prefix:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">\n // enqueuing a third-party script (chosen.js).\n wp_enqueue_script( \'chosen\', get_template_directory_uri() . \'/js/chosen.js\' );\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3><strong>Licensing Issues</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your theme and all of its files must be 100% GPL-compatible. This includes images, libraries, scripts, and fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All third-party resources must list their source and license information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This requirement can be particularly tricky as not all licenses are GPL-friendly. The Unsplash license only has one restriction:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This license does not include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That one restriction, however, is enough to make it non-GPL-compatible, and as such, you won&#8217;t see Unsplash images included in wordpress.org themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A list of GPL-compatible licenses is available here &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses\">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently,<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/\">stocksnap.io</a> has been the most common source of images in the directory as <strong>all </strong>the images they list are licensed as CC0 (GPL-compatible).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Screenshot Mistakes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The requirements state that your screenshot should be an unedited representation of your theme that doesn&#8217;t look like an advertisement. That means no photoshop work, overlays, borders or fancy effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Images must also follow the same licensing requirements we explored above.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/42HUG_N4a7-I4LHNiJzeD9iI_rVCXD0_lb3UZEiaM18zJ0giqX479QUj9Dl35j2BQObf2DHaiQ7cgvoznWclzEcNo2HuwwGgsJ5eNjFW9vZvuzuBn7gev3wRuBz6SNC1XGMwoo4M\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bonus: Use a Coding Standard</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Code that seems easy to read and understand for you, can be the complete opposite for a reviewer who only has 10-15 minutes to check your code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is no requirement on coding standards, following one does make your code easier to read, understand and maintain. I personally use and recommend the &#8216;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/\">WordPress Coding Standards</a>&#8216;, though there are others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using PHP_CodeSniffer and the WordPress ruleset in your code editor can make adhering to a standard a lot easier &#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Theme Requirements are created with the end user in mind. Avoid making the common mistakes I&#8217;ve listed above and your theme will be approved in no time.

Generally speaking, if you listen to this show on a daily basis, you should have a good idea on what&#8217;s going on in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pressing Topics is different from WordPress Weekly as we&#8217;ll rarely interview guests, go in-depth on specific subjects, and the show&#8217;s length is greatly reduced. Today&#8217;s episode is 26 minutes long and most episodes will be shorter than that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our first episode, we discuss the balancing act of user self sufficiency, a new empowerwoment project at Yoast, why countdown timers on event sites are impractical, and WPMU Dev ending development for more than 90% of their plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also talk about the success of WordPress Translation day 4, and inform listeners of multiple security vulnerabilities discovered in the WordPress Ultimate Member plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll submit the podcast to iTunes in the next few days to provide more convenient options of subscribing.

The 24-hour global event hosted 77 local events in 35 countries and the Polyglots team added 183 new contributors to their ranks. The team also designated 12 new GTEs (Global Translation Editor) and 14 PTEs (Project Translation Editor).</p>\n<p>Naoko Takano, a Polyglots Team Global Mentor and Japanese GTE, gave an <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/naokomc/introduction-to-wordpress-translation-day-4-144893265\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">introduction</a> to the event from Tokyo for the livestream. In her presentation she shared some stats on the state of WordPress translation. WordPress is currently available in 201 locales with 614 GTEs, 3,086 PTEs, and 32,585 contributors. The majority of WordPress installs are in locales other than US English, representing an estimated 18% of the web.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-13-at-2.24.45-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Takano also highlighted the top locales installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Japanese: 5.9%</li>\n<li>German: 5.5%</li>\n<li>Spanish: 5.0%</li>\n<li>French: 3.8%</li>\n<li>English (UK): 3.7%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Locales with most translation contributors include Spanish (2,863), German (2,399), Italian (2,190), Dutch (1,584), and Russian (1,515).

He explained the basics of translating WordPress and the attendees participated in Translation Day via the livestream. </p>\n<p>Dorji is passionate about completing the Dzongkha translation, encouraging Dzongkha bloggers, and improving local government websites. Many local government websites, such as the <a href=\"https://www.dzongkha.gov.bt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dzongkha Development Commission</a>, rely on WordPress. As the organizer of the fledgling meetup, Dorji is full of ideas for growing the Bhutanese WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My next plan is to visit the language university and teach them to blog in Dzongkha using WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have plans to gather a group of active Bhutanese WordPress bloggers and host panel talks. WordCamp Thimphu is my goal &#8211; to reach and invite more WordPress experts as speakers of the main event and help Bhutanese to grow their careers with WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to launching a new WordPress community in Bhutan, participants in the Translation Day event translated thousands of strings and helped new teams make progress towards launching packages for WordPress 5.2. Some of the most popular plugins and themes are now more accessible to the global WordPress user base, thanks to contributions inspired by the virtual event. </p>\n<p>Events like this are a reminder of just far-reaching WordPress&#8217; influence is across cultures. The Polyglots team is made up of a diverse and remarkably collaborative community of volunteers.

After growing tired of Trac&#8217;s mediocre search functionality, <a href=\"https://wearnhardt.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">William Earnhardt</a> set out to improve it with a new project called <a href=\"https://tracsearch.wpteamhub.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPTracSearch</a> that gave him an opportunity to play around with Elasticsearch and React.</p>\n<p>WPTracSearch provides an alternative Elasticsearch-powered interface for searching WordPress Trac tickets. It performs a full text search of all of the fields, delivering more accurate results, even for basic queries, thanks to Elasticsearch&#8217;s relevance ranking. The results can be easily filtered based on milestone, component, focuses, usernames, and more criteria, making it easier to find specific tickets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-10-at-3.01.51-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The search interface also supports fuzzy matching, adding to its ability to deliver more relevant results. Even if a term is misspelled (either in the search or the ticket) it will still yield results, as in the example below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fuzzy-match.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Earnhardt is a WordPress core contributor and a developer at Bluehost. His core team has the discretion to work on whatever they want for WordPress core and the community. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This fit in nicely with that, but was also just something fun to tinker with,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It started as a fun experiment with Elasticsearch last fall. I built an index on my local machine and played around with it but got busy with other stuff pre-5.0 push and it sort of fell by the wayside.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then early this year I had a few times come up where it would have been helpful, so I threw together an interface for it and got it online.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you want to use WPTracSearch but are not sure how current the ticket index is, Earnhardt said it&#8217;s nearly constantly in sync:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is a PHP script that parses all the information about a ticket in Trac using the XMLRPC api and puts it into an Elasticsearch index. There is a bash script that runs on a cron every minute to find any tickets updated since the last run and then uses the PHP script to reindex them. So it stays pretty constantly in sync.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The project uses a React interface that relies on the <a href=\"https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reactivesearch</a> library to query the Elasticsearch index. Earnhardt also borrowed some code from Ryan McCue’s <a href=\"https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Not Trac</a> to help with some of the UI that deals with parsing TracLinks and code blocks.</p>\n<p>WPTracSearch is an evolving project and Earnhardt has lots of plans for improving it. The two highest priority items on his roadmap are indexing meta Trac and making a search UI for it. He also wants to make the individual tickets have navigable URLs instead of being modal pop up windows when you click on the summary in the search results.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do it that way because it’s a lot faster to stay in this interface than jumping back and forth to core.trac.wordpress.org when browsing tickets, but you can’t link directly to a ticket and forward/back doesn’t work,&#8221; Earnhardt said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can also query the Elasticsearch index directly without using the React interface if you know Elasticsearch Query DSL. This allows pretty complex queries to be built. I’ve thought about creating some charts using that. It could help with the core triage team effort to better understand churn and progress toward bringing that open ticket count down. There are a lot of cool possibilities.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/earnjam/wptracsearch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPTracSearch</a> is available on GitHub if anyone wants to contribute ideas or code to improve it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 May 2019 21:42:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Tips for Replying to A Call for Papers or A Call for Speakers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89521\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/tips-for-replying-to-a-call-for-papers-or-a-call-for-speakers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10893:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a guest post written by <a href=\"https://jenniferbourn.com/\">Jennifer Bourn</a>. With 21 years experience as a graphic designer, 15 years experience as a web designer, 14 years as a creative agency owner, and 11 years as a blogger, Jennifer Bourn has worked with hundreds of service-based businesses to build brands and establish profitable online platforms. She also co-organizes the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-WordPress/\">Sacramento WordPress Meetup</a> and <a href=\"https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Sacramento</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being the lead organizer for <a href=\"https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Sacramento</a> for two years, speaker wrangler for two years, managing the program for a year, and speaking at several WordCamps and non-WordPress related conferences myself, I have seen a lot of amazing and a lot of awful speaker submissions. Some speaker submissions have been from people I know personally — people I want to choose and say yes to — but ultimately couldn’t because their submission was subpar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s incredibly tough to both apply to speak and select speakers from applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, I shared a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenniferbourn/status/1126608018953523200\">Twitter thread</a> yesterday with tips for replying to a<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CallforPapers?src=hash\"> Call for Papers or a Call for Speakers that will help you get your next talk submission accepted and it is summarized for your convenience below:</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If your title is confusing, weird, unclear, too cutesy, or it feels like you put no effort into it, that will work against you. Organizers want talks attendees will be interested in and excited for. It must be easy to understand what the talk is about based on the title alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your talk description is all about you, is only one sentence long, is sarcastic/unprofessional, isn’t aligned with the event focus/theme, or it’s totally self-serving, you should rethink things. Your talk isn’t about you, it’s about helping attendees expand their knowledge and move the needle and helping organizers host a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is never ever a good idea to disparage or put down a person, job, tool, piece of software, or anyone/anything to make your point or make your topic interesting. If the only way you can communicate your point is through negativity, reconsider the topic. Being controversial may have been a draw in years past, but now it’s a risk most organizers aren’t willing to take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider that someone else (or several people) may submit a talk on the exact same subject. Your title and description need to convince organizers why your submission should be picked over the other person’s submission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider that if you submit multiple talks, none of them may be selected if your titles aren’t interesting and your descriptions are not descriptive. It must be clear what the talk is about and what the takeaways are, and how this talk will benefit the attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always think about how you can make the organizers’ or event planners’ jobs easier and follow instructions. For example, if they ask for bios in third-person, provide your bio in third-person. If they ask for full name, provide your full name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spell the name of the conference, software, industry, etc. correctly in your speaker application. Want to speak at a WordPress event? Double check that you’ve capitalized the P and proofread your submission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the topics requested by the event organizers. Submit talks on those topics and your chances of being selected will be higher because they are telling you what they want. Lists of preferred topics are usually included because that is what their local community has specifically requested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t submit the same talk you’ve submitted 10 times to other events. Put in some effort. Look at the event theme and submit something that relates to it or customize the talk title/description to include the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the past event schedules, agenda, or programs. Look at the types of talks they accept. For example, if a WordCamp has only had 2-3 business related talks in the past four years, it might be a sign they aren’t looking for business talks and want talks focused more on using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the topics the event has already covered in previous years. Then find the gap and find something they haven’t already heard or done. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steer clear of the marketing hype. Avoid topics related to killing it, hustling, crushing, and dominating. Don’t refer to yourself as a guru or a thought leader (that’s only cool when other people say it about you). Avoid negativity, sarcasm, and assumptions about the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If organizers ask how or why you’re qualified to talk on the topic being submitted:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It’s okay to be new/just learning — fresh voices are awesome.</li><li>Don’t just copy and paste your bio into the field. They already have your bio and that’s not what they meant or what they want.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Never assume the people reviewing your application are experts on your talk topic or have the same technical background you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid submitting a talk that is all about one piece of software — i.e. one plugin — especially if the software is premium and requires an investment. An entire session dedicated to a paid plugin <strong>1)</strong> excludes those who have not purchased it or cannot purchase it and <strong>2)</strong> will apply to few attendees. Instead, consider a compare/contrast presentation that covers both free and paid options or a talk that introduces attendees to multiple options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s okay to submit opinion pieces as talks, but be careful to <strong>NOT</strong> position your opinion or approach as the only one or the right one, when there are other options. Often there isn&#8217;t one right way (unless it&#8217;s technical and there is one right way).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the submission form asks what skill level audience your talk is the best fit — Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced — don&#8217;t pick them all. That isn&#8217;t helpful. The same is true if they ask who your talk is aimed at — designers, developers, or users, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers for events like WordCamps need to satisfy a diverse audience. The attendee makeup often ranges from those who make a living with WordPress all the way to newbies who just learned what WordPress is a few days ago, so talks at and for every skill level are needed and valued. Don’t skip applying because you think your talk isn’t advanced enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is a &#8216;notes to the organizer&#8217; field in the talk submission form, communicate that you&#8217;re open to suggestions or making tweaks to the talk focus to ensure it&#8217;s a great fit for their audience. Often a talk being reviewed is close to what they want, but it needs a small tweak to be selected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If something funky happened when you hit submit, don&#8217;t be afraid to submit your talk again. Organizers would rather have duplicate submissions than miss your submission. Also, it&#8217;s okay to reach out to confirm your submission was received. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t skip applying to speak because you don&#8217;t think you know enough yet or don’t have enough experience yet. Everyone has value to contribute and fresh perspectives are always appreciated. Plus, there are people who just discovered or figured out the thing you want to talk about exists — I guarantee you can help them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the scenes organizers work hard to create a diverse lineup of speakers that provides representation for everyone in the community. Organizers can ask, beg, plead, and do loads of outreach, but ultimately, they are limited by who is willing to apply and/or who is willing to accept an invite to speak. So please say yes and apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When organizers make the offer to help you brainstorm talk ideas, craft a talk title/description, and even create your slide deck or watch your practice, say yes. Take them up on the offer. Asking for help doesn&#8217;t make you any less awesome. There are a lot of people who are incredibly talented and smart with great value to share but find it difficult to put what they know into a talk format. If that’s you, you’re not alone and there are people who want to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Interested in trying your hand at speaking for the first time? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every event has limited space. When securing rooms for multi-track events and planning the schedule, organizers need to be able to split attendees across the different rooms/tracks. This means they need competing talks in each track that will be a draw and attract attendees. No one wants one full room and one empty room. No one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t get selected, don&#8217;t get down on yourself. Often the selection choice has nothing to do with you and is simply a matter of many submissions on the same topic(s), needing to balance topics across disciplines to serve the range of attendees or skill sets, and looking for more diverse representation in the speaker lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the event is local to you, always apply. Many times event/conference organizers want to fill the speaking spots (or at least half of them) with local people from their community or region and you&#8217;ll have a leg up on the out-of-towners. Similarly, if there is a meetup group in the area tied to the event/conference, go to the meetup and get to know the organizers and other attendees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New to a subject/topic? Just learning it? No problem! Consider submitting a talk reviewing your experience as a new user. Share surprises and obstacles encountered, lessons learned, and suggestions for improvement. This can be hugely valuable for advanced users who tend to what new users deal with and it can provide a different perspective and voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to learn a topic better? There&#8217;s no better way than to teach others about it. Submit the talk, do the work to learn it, and teach everything you’ve learned so far. For example, if you want to build a membership site, submit a talk on how to choose a membership plugin, document your research in finding the right plugin, and share what plugins you reviewed, what criteria you used for evaluation, what you discovered (pros/cons), and which you ended up choosing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never underestimate the power of awareness. Consider pitching a talk that presents options to expand attendees awareness of what is available or possible and gives them a starting place to research things on their own.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 May 2019 18:32:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: Storefront 2.5.0 Introduces a Custom, Block-Based Homepage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89483\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/storefront-2-5-0-introduces-a-custom-block-based-homepage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1855:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront</a>, WooCommerce&#8217;s free flagship theme, has just released version <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2019/05/09/storefront-2-5-0-is-now-available-to-download/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2.5.0</a> with updates that make it easier to setup and customize the homepage. </p>\n<p>In 2017, WooCommerce 2.2 introduced starter content to help users set up the homepage template, menus, widgets, and add some demo products.

ACF Blocks was announced in October 2018, to the great relief of many developers who didn&#8217;t know how they were going to keep pace with learning the JavaScript required to use WordPress&#8217; Block API. </p>\n<p>ACF&#8217;s creator, Elliot Condon, was one of the more vocal critics of Gutenberg leading up to its inclusion in WordPress 5.0. Developers were concerned about whether or not their custom metaboxes generated by ACF would still be compatible. The ACF team worked to ensure the plugin was integrated into the Gutenberg UI as much as possible and surprised users by announcing an acf_register_block() function that would allow developers to use PHP to create custom blocks.</p>\n<p>The new ACF Blocks add-on is built on top of Advanced Custom Fields Pro and does not require any JavaScript knowledge. It integrates with custom fields so developers can create custom solutions. ACF blocks are rendered using a PHP template file or a callback function that allows full control of the output HTML and live previews while editing the blocks. They also maintain native compatibility with WordPress core, meaning that all Gutenberg features like &#8220;alignment&#8221; and &#8220;re-usable blocks&#8221; work as expected.</p>\n<p>Early feedback indicates that ACF Blocks has made custom Gutenberg development more approachable for developers who are not as well-versed in React, significantly speeding up the creation of custom blocks.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ACF Pro 5.8 for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> makes Gutenberg block development a breeze!

You might have come across roles such as experience architect, user experience consultant, or even customer wrangler, all of these typically involve technical knowledge, excellent communication and management skills. All of these roles are a completely foreign concept for most of our parents. The 21st century has brought with it remote work, chief growth officers, and a globalized workforce among other things.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tomovic&#8217;s survey data will identify what skills are most important in the WordPress job market right now.

The plugin now enables fewer features on setup so users can have more control over what they activate on their sites.  </p>\n<p>The new version also integrates with WordPress 5.2&#8217;s new Site Health checks. It includes a status check and moves Jetpack&#8217;s legacy debug data to a section in the new &#8220;Site Health Info&#8221; tab. The initial status check isn&#8217;t very descriptive regarding critical errors, but these error messages can be improved in future iterations so users know how to get to a page with more information. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-11.57.44-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>New Membership Block Now Available for Jetpack Beta Testers</h3>\n<p>Jetpack is getting ready to introduce a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/9802\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Membership block</a> that will essentially function like a recurring donation button using Stripe as the payment gateway. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/jetpack-membership-button.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Users will be able to set the currency, price, product name, and renewal interval directly within the block.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-block-configure.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release adds the new block behind the JETPACK_BETA_BLOCKS constant for users who are beta testing new blocks. Feedback from testers will be addressed in future pull requests. The PR merged into Jetpack 7.3 includes the following technical additions for the new Membership block:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce endpoints that communicate with WP.COM</li>\n<li>Whitelist certain options, CPTs and meta to store / sync data</li>\n<li>Introduce Gutenberg block that uses these endpoints and provides UI to connect to Stripe, create and choose a product</li>\n<li>Introduce a frontend of a block with the sole purpose of displaying a checkout window from WP.com in an iframe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In its current form, the use of the term &#8220;Membership&#8221; for the block might be a bit misleading for some users, depending on their expectations. Site owners usually expect more granular management of members, multiple membership tiers, customizable emails, various renewal options, content access, and more for managing memberships. </p>\n<p>Unless Jetpack intends to make this the gateway to more robust membership capabilities, then &#8220;Recurring donation/payment button&#8221; might be a more accurate name for the block. However, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see a more full-featured Membership module turn up as a SaaS product from WordPress.com, as opposed to everything getting packed into the plugin.</p>\n<p>No release date has been announced for the membership block as it is still under active development and in the very early stages of beta testing.</p>\n<p>Check out the full <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/#developers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">changelog</a> to see all the enhancements and bug fixes in Jetpack 7.3.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 May 2019 17:57:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2 “Jaco” Released, Includes Fatal PHP Error Protection and A Recovery Mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89405\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-jaco-released-includes-fatal-php-error-protection-and-a-recovery-mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4870:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 &#8220;Jaco&#8221; named after bassist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius\">Jaco Pastorius</a>, is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/jaco/\">now available for download</a>.

Included in the list is Alex (Viper007Bond) Mills who <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/alex-mills-ends-his-battle-with-leukemia\">passed away</a> from Leukemia earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Screenshot taken by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kraft/status/1125892606913855489\">Brandon Kraft</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mills still has a few uncommitted patches in Trac so it&#8217;s possible he&#8217;ll end up on the list of contributors in future releases. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Minimum PHP Version Required to Run WordPress 5.2 Is Now 5.6.20</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 bumps up the minimum PHP version required to 5.6.20. If you&#8217;re using an older version, you&#8217;ll need to update PHP before upgrading to WordPress 5.2. Updating PHP to version 7.3 or above <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\">is recommended</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Additional Improvements to Site Health Check </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-1-improves-editor-performance-encourages-users-to-update-outdated-php-versions\">WordPress 5.1</a>, Site Health Check features were added to inform users of outdated PHP versions. WordPress 5.2 builds on this foundation by adding two new pages that help debug common configuration issues. Users can find the Site Health section in the WordPress backend by browsing to <strong>Tools &gt; Site Health</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Site Health Check Test Results</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Browsing to the Site Health page triggers a series of tests. When the tests are performed, errors and recommended improvements are displayed on the  results page. There&#8217;s also a an Information tab that displays every detail about the configuration of your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Site Health Check Detailed Information</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme and Plugin authors can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/25/site-health-check-in-5-2/\">add their own tests</a> and modify or remove existing ones with filters. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fatal Error Protection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of seeing the dreaded &#8220;white screen of death,&#8221; WordPress 5.2 includes fatal PHP error protection. When a fatal error is detected, a user-facing error message is displayed and an email is sent to the administrator&#8217;s email address. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The email includes a link to a new feature called &#8220;recovery mode.&#8221; While in recovery mode, plugins and themes that are causing fatal errors are put into a paused state to ensure administrators can work around the errors and access the backend normally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to being informed about which themes or plugins are causing fatal errors, administrators have at least three options to fix the issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Administrators can deactivate the theme or plugin to maintain a working version of the site.</li><li>Administrators can fix the problem if they have the technical capabilities, and afterwards reactivate the theme or plugin.</li><li>Administrators can file a support request with the developer, pointing out the error.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Administrators can exit recovery mode by pressing a button in the admin bar. A few examples on how developers can utilize this feature can be <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">found here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 also includes <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">accessibility improvements</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-will-add-13-new-icons-to-the-dashicon-library\">thirteen new dashboard icons</a>, plugin compatibility checks, and an variety of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/03/whats-new-in-gutenberg-3rd-april/\">changes to the block editor</a>. In addition, the Privacy Policy page includes <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">four new helpers</a> that make customizing and designing the page easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the features in WordPress 5.2 and how to extend or work with them, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/wordpress-5-2-field-guide/\">WordPress 5.2 Field Guide</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 May 2019 17:16:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"HeroPress: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2805\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:154:\"https://heropress.com/essays/broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12270:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050819-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I was scared that if I failed to learn what I need to know, I\'d be left in the dust.\" /><p>I’ve been a web designer since 1996. In some ways, it’s hard for me to fathom. Those were the days of Netscape Navigator and table-based page layouts. I wrote every bit of HTML by hand on a seriously-underpowered computer and a tiny monitor. Definitely a far cry from where we are today.</p>\n<p>I was completely self-taught and learned by doing. When I landed my first job as a full-time “webmaster” at my <a href=\"https://cumberlink.com/\">local newspaper</a>, I didn’t even know what Photoshop was (I had been using Microsoft Paint for graphics – feel free to laugh).</p>\n<p>Looking back, I know that I wasn’t a very good designer in those days – but that didn’t matter. I felt lucky to be on the ground floor of an industry that was poised to change the world.</p>\n<h3>An Early Start</h3>\n<p>As an 18-year-old, I was often the youngest person in the office. Sometimes, that led to not being taken seriously by those in charge. Still, I did have a few mentors at the paper who were more than generous with their friendship and advice. It was my first taste of the “real world” – a lesson I sorely needed.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I realized that I wasn’t going to stay there forever. The pay wasn’t very good and the hours weren’t my cup of tea. Most of all, I just felt that I could do better. Just over a year in, I left.</p>\n<p>From there, I spent the next couple of years in various corporate settings – none of which felt very fulfilling. My existence was very much that of a worker bee. Sure, this is what happens when you’re just starting out – but I was too dense to see it that way.</p>\n<p>Again, I had a feeling that there was something else out there for me. But there didn’t seem to be a path to further my career, unless I took it upon myself to do so.</p>\n<p>So, in 1999 I went all-in as a freelancer working from home. While I’ve gone through a few different places to call home in the years since, I’m still here – thanks in great part to WordPress.</p>\n<p>But before I found both the software and community that would change my trajectory, I had to go through some ups and downs.</p>\n<h3>Hitting a Wall</h3>\n<p>Starting my own business at 21 was at once frightening and gratifying. I booked a few steady clients early on, and that provided a much-needed boost in confidence (and revenue). Yet there was also a tremendous amount of responsibility that I wasn’t prepared for. It was another real-world lesson and I had to mature in a hurry.</p>\n<p>As for technology, I upgraded my computer, but not necessarily my approach. The first several years were still ruled by building static HTML sites. And as clients started asking for more complex features such as ecommerce, I realized something about myself: I was incredibly afraid of what I didn’t know.</p>\n<p>This feeling would haunt me much more than I could have anticipated. It was like a massive weight on my shoulders. As long as work kept me in my comfort zone, I was fine. But anything outside of that brought out my anxiety.</p>\n<p>Sure, I had achieved some level of success at a young age (with a hobby site even going <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_(drink)#Revival\">viral</a>). I had plenty of work, I even moved out of my parent’s house. But I also feared the unknown. I hadn’t been a very good student in high school and had zero confidence in my ability to learn something more advanced.</p>\n<p>At the same time, that fear was joined by a great deal of frustration. I started struggling to build larger sites using those same tired methods. And maintaining them was even worse.</p>\n<p>In all, I was stressed out and felt stuck in a dead end. The passion I once had for design and code had vanished. I was in desperate need of a new direction.</p>\n<h3>A Glimmer of Light</h3>\n<p>It’s amazing how, just when things feel their darkest, a little bit of light shows up and sparks something in you. For me, WordPress was like a tiny matchstick in a pitch-black cave.</p>\n<p>Somewhere around 2005, I installed an early version of WordPress as a playful experiment. At the time, I saw other content management systems starting to pop up, but wasn’t really impressed. Frankly, the sites running them all looked the same.</p>\n<p>But tearing apart a WordPress theme was different. I knew nothing about PHP, but found that the templates were pretty easy to follow. I liked that I could make design changes without too much trouble. Even if I broke something, I was (usually) able to bring things back to their previous state.</p>\n<p>Still, I wasn’t ready or willing to abandon my old-school techniques for building sites just yet (I even jettisoned the CSS layouts from my theme and replaced them with tables). WordPress was something I used on the periphery. I created a few simple blogs for clients, but hadn’t really thought of using it for anything more.</p>\n<p>In fact, it would be a few more years until I was finally ready to make a change.</p>\n<h3>A New Beginning</h3>\n<p>2010 was a banner year in my career. It was the year where I, inspired by my wife and newborn daughter, started to really confront my fears. I had grown completely tired of the way I had been doing things. This was the year I became convinced that WordPress was the game-changer I needed.</p>\n<p>As the software matured, more developers started using it to run entire sites – not just traditional blogs. I was very much intrigued, even excited, about the possibility of what I could achieve in terms of both design and functionality.</p>\n<p>So, I convinced one of my agency clients to let me try using WordPress on a project. Things went well enough that we decided to start using it more often. And, for me, it was like that little matchstick in the dark cave turned into a huge beacon.</p>\n<p>The more I used WordPress, the more curious I became about what else it could do. I found myself not only being unafraid to learn, but actually <em>motivated</em> to do so.</p>\n<p>By the next year, I had moved almost exclusively to WordPress. That led to another watershed moment: Attending my first WordCamp.</p>\n<h3>Discovering That I Wasn&#8217;t Alone</h3>\n<p>Visiting <a href=\"https://2011.philly.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp Philadelphia 2011</a> was an eye-opening experience. This was not the buttoned-down, corporate atmosphere that brought me discomfort years earlier. Instead, I found a casual, welcoming vibe that made me feel like I belonged.</p>\n<p>The crowd was diverse in just about every way imaginable. And I met people who were all over the map when it came to knowledge of WordPress. Some were complete newbies, others were experts. But regardless of their skill level or experience, they all gathered in the same place. It struck me that I was now a part of something unique.</p>\n<p>This burgeoning community, coupled with great software, had all of the sudden put me on a path that I never imagined possible. It made me want to learn all that I could and be a part of something bigger than myself.</p>\n<p>Before too long, I discovered a confidence I never felt before. I was not only building better websites than I ever had, I was also eager to be a part of the WordPress community. And, despite being a bit shy, I even spoke at WordCamp Baltimore in <a href=\"https://2012.baltimore.wordcamp.org/speakers/#eric-karkovack\">2012</a>.</p>\n<p>I felt like anything was possible.</p>\n<h3>Opportunity Knocks</h3>\n<p>As my experience with both WordPress and its community has grown, it has opened up some amazing opportunities. For one, it gave me the courage to try and fulfill another lifelong dream: to become a writer.</p>\n<p>I started off by submitting an article to <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/how-to-deal-with-creative-differences-with-clients/\">Speckyboy Web Design Magazine</a>, not really knowing what to expect. When it was published, I was incredibly excited. So, I kept on writing. And each time, site editor Paul Andrew kept on publishing my work.</p>\n<p>Even more mind-boggling is that, eventually, this led to a regular <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/author/erickarkovack/\">role</a> with the site. I’ve published hundreds of articles and have enjoyed every minute of it. And more writing gigs have followed. My topic of choice? WordPress, of course!</p>\n<p>When it comes to my design business, I’m no longer afraid to push those boundaries. I’ve built and maintained hundreds of WordPress sites that run the gamut in terms of size and functionality. Yes, including the formerly fear-inducing ecommerce.</p>\n<p>But I know that, without the confidence boost I received by working with WordPress, none of this would have been possible. I am beyond grateful, and so glad that I found it at a pivotal time in my life.</p>\n<h3>What I&#8217;ve Learned</h3>\n<p>So, what does this all mean? I’ve given it a lot of thought.</p>\n<p>There are still days when I’m overwhelmed and stressed out. But even then, I tell myself how I lucky I am to do what I do each day. And somehow, I have maintained a passion for my work that I think is here to stay.</p>\n<p>But the biggest lesson I’ve learned, and the thing I’d like to share with you, is to give yourself a chance to learn and grow. Sometimes, the unknown can be scary – I get it. I was so afraid of the fact that I wasn’t formally trained and that I didn’t have the knowledge I needed to go further. I was scared that if I failed to learn what I needed to know that I’d be left in the dust.</p>\n<p>Yet, that’s the amazing thing about WordPress and web design in general. There are so many great resources out there you can learn from. And there is a community out there who is willing to help and share what they know.</p>\n<p>Everything is right there in front of us. All it takes is a willingness to try.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Broadening%20My%20Horizons%20Through%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbroadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbroadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbroadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress%2F&title=Broadening+My+Horizons+Through+WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/050819-min-150x150.jpg&description=Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress/\" title=\"Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/broadening-my-horizons-through-wordpress/\">Broadening My Horizons Through WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 May 2019 12:00:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Eric Karkovack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 “Jaco”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6925\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/jaco/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28801:\"<h2>Keeping Sites Safer</h2>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/05/about_maintain-wordpress-cropped.png?fit=632%2C500&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6926\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 5.2 of WordPress, named “Jaco” in honor of renowned and revolutionary jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius, is available for download or update in your WordPress dashboard.

Not doing a review doesn’t mean that you’ll lose your privileges or that you’ll have to re-apply. You’ll just not be able to have your themes set live until you finish a review.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Trusted Authors program was put in place a year ago with the goal of streamlining the review process for authors who consistently produce high quality code in line with the current guidelines. The idea was to relieve some of the burden for theme reviewers and reduce the queue. </p>\n<p>Trusted Authors are required to do a full review of a parent theme (no child themes permitted). Themes that are not approved will not count. After performing the review, the author may then upload a theme and add a comment to it with a link to their latest review that meets the requirement.</p>\n<p>The change to the program is controversial, based on the feedback from other members of the Theme Review team who commented on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/05/07/trusted-authors-changes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand the reason behind it, but I cannot agree with it,&#8221; WordPress theme author <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/ilovewpcom/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dumitru Brinzan</a> said. &#8220;Reviews should be done out of professional desire, not to buy a credit for setting a theme live quicker.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This might reduce the quality of reviews, because trusted authors are now directly interested in setting more themes live. This means that someone will have to monitor more closely the reviews done by trusted authors. This just feels unnatural somehow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Justin Tadlock, a long-time review team member who volunteered as a lead for many years, said he is disappointed to see this idea resurface after he and others shot it down multiple times in the past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I assume the team got permission from higher up the chain to run a pay-for-play system,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;We’ve already <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/04/18/theme-review-incentive-program/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">established they are not allowed</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What such systems do is provide an unfair advantage to larger theme businesses with multiple employees. They assign one of their employees to handle a review and keep pumping out themes without missing a beat. All the while, solo developers are forced into &#8216;volunteering&#8217; with time they may not even have. Not that it’s fair to businesses either; it’s just worse on solo devs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock also said that based on his experience with past incentives, forcing Trusted Authors to join the review team in order reap the benefits of the program will likely result in a decline in the quality of the reviews.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making people contribute to the review system should absolutely never happen in any shape or form,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It should never be the means in which the team shows favoritism to one author/team over another.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And, when you tie incentive programs to the review system, you tend to get shit reviews. We’ve already seen this happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock referenced the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/04/18/theme-review-incentive-program/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Review Incentive program</a> that was implemented in 2014 which became highly controversial due to a number of underlying problems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically, that program allowed the top reviewers to select the featured themes every month,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;The original idea (at least from my understanding) would be that they&#8217;d select featured themes from the list of themes that they&#8217;d reviewed.  Instead, they chose their own themes, month after month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What ended up happening is that many of those top reviewers would just burn through reviews, focusing on number rather than quality.  Bad, sometimes insecure, code would fall through the cracks.  Some themes really didn&#8217;t even get anywhere near a proper review.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In response to Tadlock referencing the past incentive program, Cosmin pointed out several differences with the new Trusted Author requirement to join the review team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The last time we did this it was a competition for the Featured page (which in my opinion is of higher value than having a theme on Latest),&#8221; Cosmin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/05/07/trusted-authors-changes/#comment-43743\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Back then you also had to do a lot of reviews just to get the chance of selecting a featured theme.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With TAs you don’t lose anything, you either do or not the review, you keep your TA status. One review a month is just 15-30 minutes of reviewing. Either way they are still ‘pumping out themes without missing a beat.’ Any TA author that has time to pump out 3-4 themes a month also has time to do a freaking review.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Theme Review Team Leadership Did Not Consult the Team Before Implementing Changes to Trusted Authors Program</h3>\n<p>This change to the Trusted Authors Program seems to have blindsided other members of the Theme Review Team who only learned of it from the announcement today. The idea was not discussed publicly in the #themereview channel on Slack. It was a unilateral decision made by the leadership behind closed doors. </p>\n<p>I asked Cosmin for background on the decision and he said it was discussed in a private meeting of Theme Review Team leads that included William Patton and Ganga Kafle. He said the decision just happened while they were discussing the current state of the <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/report/2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">queue</a> and how things are not going well. </p>\n<p>There are 120 themes waiting to be reviewed and Cosmin estimated that authors are waiting approximately two months in order to get their themes approved. He said the changes to the Trusted Authors program are &#8220;currently the only viable option with short term results.&#8221; </p>\n<p>However, Tadlock is concerned that Trusted Authors who didn&#8217;t have the desire to review themes prior to the requirement might simply do the minimum possible to stay in the program. It also sets a precedent for requiring volunteer time in order to receive the benefit of a streamlined review.</p>\n<p>This particular controversy is another milestone in the Theme Review Team&#8217;s perennial struggle with an unmanageable queue. In the past, the team has entertained suggestions about relaxing the submission guidelines and limiting reviews to security concerns, but changes in this direction never seem to materialize. So far the team has had success with limiting authors to submitting one theme at a time. It slows the growth of the directory but makes the work more manageable for the volunteers who often find themselves knee-deep in manual code review without an end in sight.</p>\n<p>The new requirement for Trusted Authors to perform reviews in order to have their themes set live may still be up for discussion if other reviewers continue to raise concerns, but comments from the leads indicate that they want to give it a try before scrapping the idea. In response to Tadlock&#8217;s concern about the potential impact on the quality of reviews, Cosmin said the leadership will decide based on how the program goes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s expected that TAs are experienced authors that know the requirements,&#8221; Cosmin said. &#8220;We’ll monitor this and if it’s the other way around, we’ll decide then. We get shit reviews right now without having any incentives.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 07 May 2019 19:15:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: Tabor Theme Now Available as a Free Gatsby Theme for WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89336\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/tabor-theme-now-available-as-a-free-gatsby-theme-for-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2407:\"<p><a href=\"https://gatsbywpthemes.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby WordPress Themes</a>, a project launched earlier this year by a group of collaborators, has just released its second free theme.

After installing a few plugins, top-level menu items begin to pile on. This adds even more complexity to grapple with in a narrow space with long lists of items hidden behind flyout menus that make managing WordPress on mobile a frustrating experience. </p>\n<p>The admin dashboard design hasn&#8217;t changed significantly since the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MP6 plugin</a> was merged into <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-8-parker-released\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 3.8</a> in 2013. This project brought updated typography and improved contrast to the admin but didn&#8217;t tackle the increasing complexity of admin navigation. </p>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47012\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal on trac</a> aims to simplify the left sidebar navigation to improve accessibility, usability, and scalability by replacing the flyouts with accordion menus. Designer <a href=\"https://davemart.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Martin</a> shared some mockups originally created by <a href=\"https://joen.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joen Asmussen</a>, and describes them as &#8220;a very early, exploratory concept.&#8221; </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-06-at-11.32.11-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Martin listed several reasons for exploring a new design, including the inaccessibility of the hover/flyout menus and how poorly they scale on mobile interfaces. He also cited the abundance of top-level menu items that are rarely used, which he said contributes to the cognitive weight of admin navigation by still being permanently visible.</p>\n<p>The major changes included in this proposal include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flyout menus are replaced with accordion behavior. This scales all the way from mobile to desktop, and affords better accessibility.</li>\n<li>Menu is made 80px wider (240px vs. 160), affording a 14px minimum font size for all items, perhaps bigger icons in the future, more relaxed spacing, enhancing usability and accessibility.</li>\n<li>Sidebar is grouped in major sections, “Site”, “Design”, “Tools” and “Manage”.</li>\n<li>“Updates” are moved to a subsection of “Manage”, making Home a single item.</li>\n<li>Items related to content on your site (such as “Posts” and “Pages”) are moved under “Site”.</li>\n<li>Clicking major menu items just opens or closes the accordion, as opposed to go directly to the first subsection. This unifies the mobile and desktop behavior. You can keep the accordion open if you use it all the time (each click will save state, so you’ll see the same open/closed sections upon page refresh).</li>\n<li>All “Settings” subsections are moved under “Manage”, along with “Plugins &#038; Blocks” and “Users”.</li>\n<li>Separators group major categories, like “Site” and “Design” together</li>\n<li>Dashboard is renamed “Home”, because all of WordPress is a Dashboard, and “Home” is where you can get an overview at a glance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress core committer John Blackbourn commented on the proposal, recommending further exploration of what the menu could look like for different user roles and whether that might affect the appearance, grouping, and behavior of the menu items. For example, roles with more limited publishing capabilities, such as a subscriber, would see very few menu items. </p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a bit of discussion regarding the use of the word &#8216;Site&#8217; where some might better understand that section as &#8216;Content.&#8217; As this is just an initial mockup, nothing is set in stone and many iterations will likely follow.</p>\n<p>Even with many changes expected as the concept evolves, the proposed design significantly reduces cognitive load, especially for new users who may not be as familiar with the admin menu. An updated admin navigation design might lend itself well to being tested as a feature plugin. As with any major change in WordPress, there are many considerations for how it will affect plugin developers. Major visual overhauls like this are exciting, but it takes time to get it right. This proposal already shows a lot of promise but needs more feedback and participation from diverse user groups across the WordPress community. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 06 May 2019 20:20:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Plugin for OctoberCMS Now in Beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89297\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-plugin-for-octobercms-now-in-beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2833:\"<p>Last week we reported on <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laraberg, a Gutenberg implementation for Laravel</a> that is now in beta.

OctobeCMS was launched in 2015, and still captures only a tiny sliver of the CMS market share, but it is growing in popularity among the top one million websites, according to stats from <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/October-CMS\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BuiltWith</a>. The CMS has a growing ecosystem of more than 700 themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/plugin/reazzon-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg for OctoberCMS</a> plugin is now in beta. It allows developers to embed Gutenberg in the backend via their own model by <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/docs/database/relations#polymorphic-relations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">creating a Polymorphic relation</a>. The plugin integrates Laraberg but all of its blocks are standard from the Gutenberg.js package. It doesn&#8217;t include anything custom. </p>\n<p>Most aspects of Gutenberg are working in the beta, including common blocks, formatting, layout, and embed blocks, custom styles, and block settings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gutenberg-october-cms.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>None of WordPress&#8217; standard widgets work in the plugin and Khaetsky said he plans to remove them in future updates.</p>\n<p>Anything that requires media uploading, such as the gallery block, inline images, and cover block, are not working. Khaetsky said he is working on getting the plugin integrated with the native OctoberCMS Medialibrary. He encouraged anyone who wants to contribute to that effort to submit a PR to the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/FlusherDock1/Gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a>. </p>\n<p>Khaetsky&#8217;s free plugin is MIT-licensed and available in the official OctoberCMS plugin marketplace.

Carandang created Block Options prior to co-founding CoBlocks, which was recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by GoDaddy</a>. It began as a plugin for controlling block visibility, inspired by his <a href=\"https://widget-options.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Widget Options</a> plugin, but has since grown to include more features for managing Gutenberg blocks. EditorsKit now offers the following capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Devices Visibility Options</li>\n<li>User Login State Visibility</li>\n<li>Display Logic</li>\n<li>Advanced Custom Fields Integration</li>\n<li>Block Guide Lines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;As much as I love the name &#8216;Block Options,&#8217; it has started to become too generic and has been used a lot on the Gutenberg editor itself,&#8221; Carandang said. &#8220;So, I have decided to change the name to something that stands out and fits the purpose more – page building block options for the new editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The name EditorsKit came from &#8216;Editor’s Toolkit.&#8217; I’ve been progressively moving towards building a set of tools that will help users navigate through the editor more conveniently, besides giving them visibility control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Version 1.4 of the plugin introduces the new Block Guide Lines feature, one of the features to go beyond visibility management. It allows users to toggle guide lines on/off for titles and editor blocks to check element boundaries. Carandang said the feature becomes especially useful when handling nested blocks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The last major release of the plugin also improves the UI and UX with a new “Visibility Settings” modal for managing all visibilities in the same place. The modal includes an &#8220;Advanced&#8221; tab for more complicated options that are more likely to be used by developers, such as custom display logic and ACF visibility support.</p>\n<p>Under the umbrella of its new branding and <a href=\"https://editorskit.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, Carandang plans to expand EditorsKit to include more tools, with the next set focused on developers.

Unlike other approaches to &#8220;headless&#8221; WordPress, Frontity is the first to be built exclusively for WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PS: Can you give us an overview of Frontity&#8217;s history and how your company, product, and brand has developed?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Reyes_final-copy-752x501.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-61434\" />Reyes Martínez</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> It all started back in 2015 when Pablo Postigo and Luis Herranz created Worona, a free WordPress plugin to turn blogs into mobile apps. Pablo and Luis discovered a lot of people were concerned about the way their WordPress sites performed on mobile devices. They thought it would be a  powerful solution to build an open source platform that could be extended by other WordPress developers.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met Pablo and Luis in late 2015, loved their project and joined them. I was used to working with WordPress as a content editor, but I didn’t have a technical background. So I mostly started helping by writing blog posts, social media content, documentation, and providing user support. Now I’m in charge of Frontity’s marketing and communications. (I still don’t code but would love to learn at some point!)<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that first prototype, they decided to develop a free platform not just for creating mobile apps. The idea was that any WordPress user could build mobile apps, progressive web apps, or add Google AMP to their blogs in a very easy way. This was Worona 1.0, which was launched in February of 2017. Thousands of WordPress users joined that journey, and we’re truly thankful for that. At that time we already used React and fetched the blog’s content using WordPress&#8217;s REST API. The mobile apps were created with <a href=\"https://cordova.apache.org/\">Cordova</a>.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Worona had a loyal following, we were aware that mobile app usage was slowly declining. People don’t want to download an app for every blog they read. Plus, Apple stopped supporting apps from app generation platforms like ours. This became a serious problem as we couldn’t grow under that scenario.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when we decided to bet on the mobile web and started working on a new framework for building Progressive Web App themes (based on React) on top of WordPress. In 2018 we rebranded to Frontity and got financial backing to make the project grow. Although our main goal was to keep the code open source, we decided to use it internally and release a product exclusively to WordPress publishers (we called it Frontity PRO), so we could see what happened and gather feedback.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frontity PRO is a proprietary mobile theme built on React for WordPress blogs and news sites. It implements Progressive Web App technologies and uses the REST API to fetch the content, along with our WordPress plugin, WordPress<em> </em>PWA.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time Frontity PRO was created, <a href=\"https://blog.frontity.org/how-frontity-contributed-official-wceu-pwa/\">we also contributed to the official WCEU PWA</a>. Building a PWA from the ground up is a difficult and time-consuming task, but we had created a framework to precisely solve that problem. It was the perfect time to test it out and give back to the community.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have worked with Spanish media companies since we launched Frontity PRO, and the result has been great. Our theme has allowed them to deliver faster and more engaging mobile experiences, which has been proven to increase their pageviews and ad revenue. Our internal framework has served content to more than 20 million readers. Some of our major clients were part of ADSLZone group. Others include <em>Medios y Redes</em>, <em>Tendenzias</em> or <a href=\"http://coches.com/\">Coches.com</a>. They all use WordPress.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this time, we realized that many of our clients&#8217; tech teams were considering using our framework to develop their own custom themes. This was one of the main reasons that made us think about open sourcing it — it seemed the perfect moment. Plus, this was our original vision.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months ago, we finally decided to go straight for that vision. We set aside the development work of Frontity PRO to place all our focus on Frontity.org, the open source framework. Our next milestone is to release the first beta version in the next few weeks. (Early May 2019.) More than 300 developers have already signed up to try it out. We are really excited about this project and believe it can make a real impact in the WordPress ecosystem.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our resources are limited, we are looking for some financial backing again to bring contributors on board and build a thriving community of people interested in WordPress and React.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PS: What problems does Frontity solve? (And whose problems are they?) Will Frontity make frontend development more accessible to people who are new to React?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> In order to create a WordPress theme with React, developers need to learn and configure lots of different things: bundling, transpiling, routing, server rendering, retrieving data from WordPress, managing state, managing CSS, linting, testing,&#8230;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are already some amazing React frameworks, such as Next.js and GatsbyJS, that can work with WordPress, but they&#8217;re not focused exclusively on it. As a result, there&#8217;s still some complex configuration and additional tooling left to the developer. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what Frontity aims to solve; we want to make everything much simpler for WordPress developers and more accessible to those who are new to React. Each part of the framework has been simplified and optimized to be used with WordPress, and developers don&#8217;t need to figure out what tools to use for things like CSS or state management.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is ready so they can get WordPress and React to work together in an easier way. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does Frontity differ from Genesis, _s, or WP Rig — from the developer and designer&#8217;s perspective, and in the end user&#8217;s experience?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> Genesis, _s or WP Rig are fantastic frameworks to develop WordPress themes based on PHP. These themes use the PHP WordPress rendering engine, which means they rely on a server-side architecture where almost every interaction that is made by the user on his device needs to wait for the server to render the new result. Our framework is focused on developers who want to create a React frontend and connect it to a WordPress backend using the REST API. We can call this a client-side architecture, where all the logic and rendering happen directly on the device and the calls to the server are limited only to data sourcing.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years, web development has evolved a lot. One of the main reasons is the shift to mobile devices and the need for fast web experiences. Achieving this is not easy using a server-side architecture. This is why client-side libraries like React are becoming so popular.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the developer perspective, everything changes! A theme developed with Frontity and React has zero PHP in it, only JavaScript and CSS. This might sound like a radical change, but there is a trend of developers using WordPress as a headless CMS with a decoupled JavaScript frontend for whom our framework can be quite useful.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does Frontity the framework fit into a business model or revenue stream for Frontity the company?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> We won&#8217;t develop any business model in this initial phase. The framework will always be 100% free and open source. Right now, we are focused on building a community of developers and contributors around the framework.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Possible monetizations in the future are a hosting solution, premium support, or a marketplace of paid themes.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see for WordPress developers now and in the near future? </strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> With the shift to Gutenberg as well as the rise of headless CMS approaches, the WordPress community has started considering React for their projects. Beside this, modern libraries like React are becoming essential to rich user experiences.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The client-side approach to theme-building opens a world of new possibilities: storing and pre-fetching content, animations within themes, offline experiences, and more. It also has enormous benefits in terms of performance, UX and design.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>React presents an opportunity to accelerate things in the WordPress ecosystem, build modern and engaging frontend experiences, and extend what developers can do with this powerful CMS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Pictured in the Frontity team photo above, from left to right, back row first: Eduardo Campaña (developer), David Arenas (developer), Carmen Fernández (no longer with the company), Mario Santos, (Community), Reyes Martínez (Marketing &amp; Communications), Pablo Postigo (Founder &amp; CEO), and Luis Herranz (Founder &amp; Lead developer).</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 May 2019 17:48:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2019 Tickets Now on Sale\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89259\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2019-tickets-now-on-sale\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3340:\"<p><a href=\"https://2019.us.wordcamp.org/tickets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tickets</a> for WordCamp US 2019 went on sale this week.

The audit was crowdfunded by the WordPress community and Matt Mullenweg and Automattic pledged to cover the balance to ensure it would be fully funded. </p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s analysis includes a <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">329-page technical audit</a> of the editor along with <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_UX_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">user-based testing</a> that included people with various disabilities. WPCampus&#8217; announcement presents Tenon&#8217;s findings in a measured and diplomatic way, encouraging the community to use the report for improving WordPress: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Please use this report as what it is intended to be: constructive feedback in support of the WordPress project. We hope this report generates discussion about accessibility, excitement about inclusive design, and action toward improving the editing experience.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Beyond its use for WordPress core, the audit is also a valuable resource for those extending Gutenberg and more broadly for developers who are building React-based projects.</p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s report includes a 34-page <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Executive_Summary.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Summary</a>, highlighting key findings from the usability testing and technical review. It&#8217;s important to note that the audit was conducted on WordPress version 5.0.3 in January 2019. Since that time the Gutenberg and Accessibility teams have resolved an additional <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AAccessibility+closed%3A%3E2019-01-03\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">116 accessibility issues</a>, which will be included in WordPress 5.2 next week.</p>\n<p>As expected, Tenon&#8217;s results show that overall the markup generated by Gutenberg is &#8220;clean, semantically correct and accessible&#8221; but that &#8220;Gutenberg’s user experience is consistently poor.&#8221; The audit found that Gutenberg fails to comply with all 30 of the WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria. </p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s findings confirm the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-delivers-sobering-assessment-of-gutenberg-we-have-to-draw-a-line\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> WordPress&#8217; Accessibility Team published in October 2018 regarding the editor&#8217;s overall level of accessibility:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;The accessibility team will continue to work to support Gutenberg to the best of our ability. However, based on its current status, we cannot recommend that anybody who has a need for assistive technology allow it to be in use on any sites they need to use at this time.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>At that time, many WordPress contributors urged leadership not to ship an editor with critical accessibility issues that prevented people using assistive technologies from moving forward with the latest version.</p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s Executive Summary concludes that the new editor is a step backwards for people with disabilities:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gutenberg has significant and pervasive accessibility problems, the likes of which amount to a step backwards for users with disabilities over the legacy editor. Our user-based testing – backed by data from our technical review – indicates that the accessibility problems are severe in nature. We feel concerned that Gutenberg’s current accessibility issues will prove problematic for website owners who deploy Gutenberg to content creators in protected populations or for website owners who are themselves part of a protected population. Therefore, organizations which have high risk profiles should consult legal counsel before using it and may want to choose to use the legacy editor instead.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tenon recommended that Gutenberg&#8217;s developers aggressively tackle the issues uncovered in the <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">technical report</a>, given the size of WordPress&#8217; user base. The full report essentially functions as a guide for anyone who wants to contribute to the new editors&#8217; accessibility. It is an excellent resource that outlines each issue with solutions and recommended code, making it easy for developers to get started with meaningful contributions right away. Tenon has <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/created_by/karlgroves\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">created a collection of 84 issues on GitHub</a> based on the findings in the audit and six of them have already been resolved/closed. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 May 2019 19:59:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 RC2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6914\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-rc2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2474:\"<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 5.2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 will be released on <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-2/\">Tuesday, May 7</a></strong>, but we need <em>your</em> help to get there—if you haven’t tried 5.2 yet, now is the time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.2 release candidate: try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want to select the “bleeding edge nightlies” option), or you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.2-RC2.zip\">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For details about what to expect in WordPress 5.2, please see the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">first release candidate post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes the final About page design.

This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Went through some hard times when I was in university. It was also difficult for me to pay the university dues due to financial shortcomings.</p>\n<p>I am a sportsman and still have a wish to play in International Cricket which seems impossible from where I am today. At one point, I wished to join Pakistan Air Force but life directed me towards Computer Sciences.</p>\n<p>I started using a computer in ​2010​ when I joined <a href=\"https://gcuf.edu.pk/\">​Government College University Faisalabad​</a>. Came to know about WordPress while I was finishing the last semester of my degree and my FYP was based on WordPress.</p>\n<p>My mother&#8211;who is no more in this world&#8211;was the real hero of my life and stayed by my side till her last breath. I remember my kindergarten days when she helped me with my homework. I remember the moments in which she used to stay standing in front of the house while I drove off to school.</p>\n<p>I remember her last day at the hospital. I met her in the ICU before her heart surgery. She hugged me and said ​“<strong>Don’t worry, everything will be good</strong>”​. She expired during the surgery. I pray for her soul to rest in peace every day.</p>\n<h3>Start of Career:</h3>\n<p>Something had always felt missing in my life, but I felt like I was on the right track for the first time in my life when I joined the WordPress community. After graduation, I struggled a lot to get my first job. I joined <a href=\"https://www.presstigers.com/\">​PressTigers​</a> as a Software Engineer and continued struggling to make my position better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FahadShakeel\">Khawaja Fahad Shakeel​</a> was my first mentor. For me, it has always been an honour to work with him. He directed me towards the right path and provided me with endless support.</p>\n<h3>Community &#8211; WordCamps and Meetups:</h3>\n<p>I am using WordPress since ​2015​. Once I started attending meetups and open source contribution, it turned out to be a game changer for me.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>I learned a lot of things from the WordPress Community platform. There are a lot of personalities who have left a deep impression on met. One of them is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jainnidhi03\">​Nidhi Jain​</a> from Udaipur India. At this point, she is like a sister to me. We have an amazing chemistry when it comes to working on WordPress dev. The second one is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/desrosj\">​Jonathan Desrosiers​</a> who is like my big brother whom I have learned a lot from and continue to do more every day.</p>\n<p>WordPress Community is where I feel the most comfortable, after my family. I am supporting local WordPress communities and was part of ​WordCamp Karachi​ as an organizer. It was the first time that I spoke in an international level event.</p>\n<p>People around the globe know me because of WordPress. This is why WordPress is my identity. I owe a huge part of who I am to the WordPress Community.</p>\n<h3>WordPress and Future:</h3>\n<p>I believe WordPress can never die as long as people don’t stop baking new things and curating it according to the demands of the new era.</p>\n<p><em>The beauty of WordPress is that it is made for everyone.</em></p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Lahore/members/?op=leaders&sort=name\">​co-organizer of WordPress Meetup Lahore​</a> it is an honor for me to provide a platform for people to gather under one roof, to learn and share something with the community. I believe in diversity and would love to involve more people in the community leadership team.</p>\n<p>I am extremely hopeful regarding the WordPress Meetup Lahore group and welcome everyone to contribute into making it great.</p>\n<p>I have been terribly impressed by <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/\">​Marcel​</a> as he walked for WC Europe and I would love to walk for WC Asia after the approval.</p>\n<p>In the future, if I get a chance in politics, I wish to be a part of upper house as a <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov.pk/\">​SENATOR OF PAKISTAN​</a>. Hopefully, I will be contesting in the next senate election either from the platform of the ruling party or as an independent candidate.</p>\n<h3>Community Mentor:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Usman__Khalid\">Usman Khalid​</a>, the lead organizer of WC Karachi, is the hero behind the scenes for establishing the communities in Pakistan. He has mentored me for community relevant stuff. I would love to credit him, the person who gathered the Pakistani WordPress folks under one roof for the first time.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>Message for WordPressers:</h3>\n<p><em>If you seriously want to do something for yourself, do something for others first.</em></p>\n<p>Go for open source, you’ll surely learn how to code. You’ll learn how to work in a team. Join local meetups, meet with the folks: help them, learn from them and share ideas.</p>\n<h3>Wrap Up:</h3>\n<p>One thing I have learned from life is that there is no shortcut to success. You have to work hard to achieve your goals. The person who lives in a fantasy world will never succeed in life.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I have achieved something great. I still have the thirst to do something; lots and lots of missions to be accomplished. My only wish is to do something different for this world which will be remembered long after I am gone.</p>\n<p>Together we grow.

This indicates that the JavaScript user base is becoming more sophisticated overall. </p>\n<p>Another trend is the rising popularity of GraphQL. While its adoption is still relatively low, with only 7% of respondents indicating that they use it frequently, 23% of developers use it for some of their projects. The results showed that 72% of npm users are using or considering using GraphQL in 2019.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-26-at-4.36.13-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In a post that goes further in depth on <a href=\"https://medium.com/npm-inc/methodology-of-the-2018-2019-javascript-ecosystem-survey-and-results-b1cef1b83f10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the methodology used for the survey</a>, nmp Inc. said the company did not collect demographics on race or gender identity, so the data may not be representative of the broader population of JavaScript users on these metrics.

NetBeans joins more than 350 other open source projects and initiatives managed by the foundation after spending two years in the Apache Incubator.</p>\n<p>The IDE supports Java, JavaScript, PHP, HTML5, and other popular programming languages, and is also used as a tooling platform and application framework. Although PhpStorm and Sublime Text capture a larger share of the IDE market for PHP developers, there is a small but passionate segment of WordPress developers who favor NetBeans as their IDE of choice.</p>\n<p>NetBeans started as a student project in 1996 in what was formerly known as Czechoslovakia. It was the first Java IDE written in Java but it soon became more than just an IDE platform, as the community began using it to create applications that weren&#8217;t development tools. In 2000, Sun Microsystems acquired NetBeans and open sourced it, making it Sun&#8217;s first sponsored open source project. It became part of Oracle when it acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 and the company continues to sponsor the project. NetBeans is now used by more than 1.5 million users each month.</p>\n<p>Now that Apache NetBeans is governed by the ASF, it will be more likely to receive contributions than when it belonged to a commercial entity. However, contributors from Oracle and other organizations will continue to be part of shaping its future. Coming under the ASF umbrella is also bringing some welcome developments for the project&#8217;s governance, according to Apache NetBeans Vice President Geertjan Wielenga:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being part of the ASF means that NetBeans is now not only free and Open Source software: it is also, uniquely, and for the first time, part of a foundation specifically focused on enabling open governance. Every contributor to the project now has equal say over the roadmap and direction of NetBeans. That is a new and historic step and the community has been ready for this for a very long time. Thanks to the strong stewardship of NetBeans in Sun Microsystems and Oracle, Apache NetBeans is now ready for the next phase in its development and we welcome everyone to participate as equals as we move forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oracle&#8217;s decision to submit NetBeans to the ASF Incubator came as a surprise to many in 2016. At that time, OSI President Simon Phipps <a href=\"https://meshedinsights.com/2016/09/15/oracle-gets-it-right-netbeans-heads-to-apache/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shared his thoughts</a> about the benefits he saw for the project moving to open governance under the ASF:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By moving to independent governance and losing the Oracle CLA, others can join in with confidence their contribution won’t be used against them. More importantly, contributors also no longer need fear the transient decisions of cost-cutting Oracle VPs impacting the long-term viability of the project. Oracle’s Java team still needs NetBeans in order to make tools releases supporting new capabilities in Java 9 and later, so are likely to engage. Rather than withdrawal, this looks more like leveraging the ecosystem around NetBeans to sustain development while keeping Oracle’s costs in line with the direct benefit NetBeans delivers to them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/NetBeansProposal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> submitted to the ASF for NetBeans&#8217; acceptance into the Incubator, the majority of code contributions have come from Oracle since it acquired Sun Microsystems. In addressing some of the known risks Oracle faces in contributing NetBeans to the ASF, the proposal states that &#8220;the size and diversity of the community is a guarantee against the project being orphaned.&#8221; </p>\n<p>NetBean&#8217;s proposal said the purpose of moving NetBeans to Apache is to &#8220;expand the diversity of contributors and to increase the level of meritocracy.&#8221; The project already has a good foundation to build on, as its application framework is used by large companies and organizations, including Boeing, Airbus Defense and Space, NASA, and NATO, that depend on NetBeans for building mission critical scientific software. This new era of open governance should give the community a stronger sense of ownership and stimulate greater levels of contribution across the project. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 02:18:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6909\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3119:\"<p>The first release candidate for WordPress 5.2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important milestone as we progress toward the WordPress 5.2 release date. “Release Candidate” means that the new version is ready for release, but with millions of users and thousands of plugins and themes, it’s possible something was missed.

However, more than half of all WordPress users (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">~55%</a>) are not running version 5.0+. Nearly 30% are hanging back at 4.9 and 25% are on even older versions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-23-at-10.05.35-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a> </p>\n<p>Theme authors who create products that have Gutenberg-only features are not yet building for the majority of WordPress users. These authors are carving a path for the future of theme development. The Clean Blocks theme doesn&#8217;t really fall into this category, as its essentially enables users on WordPress 5.0+ to continue using the new editor without any styling issues. It is also compatible with earlier versions of WordPress (4.8+).</p>\n<p>Clean Blocks recommends a collection of Catch Themes&#8217; functionality plugins upon theme activation. These plugins handle things like galleries, infinite scroll, Instagram feeds, widgets, and additional content types. The theme includes dozens of options in the Customizer for controlling nearly every aspect of how content is displayed &#8211; from excerpt length to categories displayed on the home page to header text color. This sort of overloaded Customizer options panel is common for multipurpose style themes, and many users have come to expect it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://catchthemes.com/demo/clean-blocks-free/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out a demo</a> of the free version to see all the features in action.</p>\n<p>The name &#8220;Clean Blocks&#8221; implies that the theme goes beyond the basics to customize the Gutenberg experience, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. The vast majority of the features seen in the demo are controlled by the Customizer. For example, features like Testimonials and Services are not available as blocks. While some theme authors opt to integrate features like this by pairing their themes with block collection plugins, Catch Themes has put everything into the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Even with Gutenberg compatibility, many themes still have a disconnect between the back and frontend where certain features can only be configured in the Customizer. This fractured customization experience is one of the necessary evils for this transition time before the block editor is fully capable of handling more complex aspects of site customization.</p>\n<p>Clean Blocks is an example of a multipurpose theme that is essentially keeping it old school in terms of content customization, while providing basic Gutenberg compatibility for users who are running WordPress 5.0+. The theme is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/clean-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on WordPress.org</a> and has already been downloaded several hundred times during its first week in the directory. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 22:46:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Laraberg, a Gutenberg Implementation for Laravel, is Now in Beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89058\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3954:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/laraberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The family of Gutenberg derivatives is expanding with the beta release of <a href=\"https://github.com/VanOns/laraberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laraberg</a>, an implementation for Laravel. <a href=\"http://mauricewijnia.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Maurice Wijnia</a>, a developer at <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Van Ons</a>, an agency based in Amsterdam, created Laraberg as an easy way for developers building applications with Laravel to integrate the Gutenberg editor. It includes a simple API and support for the <a href=\"https://unisharp.github.io/laravel-filemanager/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel File Manager</a> for uploading files.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/laraberg-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal for Laraberg is to give developers the ability to add the Gutenberg editor to any page they like in a way that is as easy as possible, but at the same time it has to prove enough options to tailor the editor so it can fit into any Laravel project out there,&#8221; Wijnia said.</p>\n<p>Van Ons has a <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/nieuws/gutenberg-in-laravel-hier-is-laraberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">preference for using Laravel</a> in their projects, due to its increasing popularity and active community. Laraberg makes it possible for the agency to tap into the convenience of the Gutenberg editor without giving up the performance and features they enjoy in the Laravel framework. The beta release is now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/VanOns/laraberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/van-ons/laraberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Packagist</a>. Van Ons plans to actively implement Laraberg in their own projects and will also be collecting feedback from beta testers. </p>\n<p>Wijnia said he was inspired by the <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project, whose creators also authored <a href=\"https://github.com/front/gutenberg-js\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg.js</a>, a package that makes it easier to bring Gutenberg into other applications. Providing a foundation for using Gutenberg on any CMS or framework is part of Frontkom&#8217;s long term vision for improving the open web and enabling communities to collaborate on mutually beneficial extensions.</p>\n<p>As the editor continues to expand to more platforms and frameworks, a CMS-agnostic block library would offer a central place for Gutenberg&#8217;s increasingly diverse user base to discover new blocks. WordPress.org has the opportunity to provide that in its own block library, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/#comment-8947\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with the support of the Gutenberg Cloud team</a> that pioneered the idea in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If Gutenberg Cloud can serve as a proof of concept that WP.org can later adopt as their own, we are happy,&#8221; Frontkom CTO Per Andre Rønsen said. He also further commented on the WordPress.org Block Library proposal, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-cloud-team-advocates-for-making-wordpress-orgs-new-block-directory-a-cms-agnostic-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">advocating for the team to grow their vision beyond the WordPress community</a> only. No official decision has been announced yet. If WordPress decides to forgo the opportunity of providing a block library inclusive of other frameworks and platforms, then the Gutenberg Cloud will continue to be the place for discovering blocks that can be used across multiple platforms.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 17:24:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"HeroPress: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2786\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30665:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042419-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Be the person you needed when you were younger.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#pt-br\">Este ensaio também está disponível em português.</a></p>\n<p>As I make a checklist of all the things I’ll have to pack to travel from São Paulo to Berlin, to attend WordCamp Europe 2019, I can&#8217;t stop thinking how hard the path to this point has been.</p>\n<p>For some of people, a travel like this may seem ordinary, but for me, this will be the farthest I&#8217;ve ever been until now, in many ways. Especially because the last time I was planning to attend an international WordCamp, things didn&#8217;t work out at all.</p>\n<p>So let me tell you about the path.</p>\n<h3>The first steps</h3>\n<p>I was born and raised in São Paulo. Allow me to give you some context about my city. São Paulo is the richest and biggest city of Brazil. With more than 14 million people, it&#8217;s also the biggest city of the south hemisphere. It&#8217;s even bigger than New York.</p>\n<p>Like every big city, São Paulo is a place of opportunities, but also a place of contrasts.</p>\n<p>Growing up, although we were poor, my family cared a lot about the education of me and my little brother. My father who always liked technology, managed to get a computer for us in 1996. At that time, I was 6 years old, and we were the only family in my neighborhood to have a computer for a long time, and that was sad. That early exposure to technology made a big difference in my life.</p>\n<p>At age 13, I was very interested in graphic design and coding.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a very limited and expensive dial-up internet, that was only free after midnight and at weekends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So to learn these skills, my best options were the CD-ROM magazines that my father would bring home. I also learned about HTML with a book about Microsoft Front Page. At age 14 I sold my first website, entirely created on Front Page, with lots of GIFs and &lt;marquee&gt; tags, for a neighbour who needed it for a college project. She loved it!</p>\n<p>I decided I wanted to work with design. So I started a Graphic Design course during the high school. With my love for web design, all I wanted was to have a site that was actually online. I couldn’t afford a host, but fortunately at this time, blogs became very popular here in Brazil.</p>\n<p>I looked for a platform to create a portfolio. I played a little with one called WordPress (you may have heard of it) and ended up using Blogger instead, because there was the possibility to customize the theme’s CSS online. I made a very dark grungy theme for my blog that’s still online.</p>\n<h3>A bumpy road</h3>\n<p>I got a scholarship for Graphic Design at a good College in São Paulo, but I still would have to pay for half of the monthly tuition. The problem was that my family definitely had no means to afford it. My parents said they would cut some expenses and help me, but I knew that there wasn’t anything they could cut. So I told them to not worry, I would find a job.</p>\n<p>At this point I had made a freelance gig creating a HTML website (in Dreamweaver this time). With exactly 1 month left for the College application, this client proposed that I started working there to maintain the website I just made. So I was able to (barely) pay for the college. After six months, I applied for a full scholarship and it was granted. Things got a little better financially, but the path was still rocky.</p>\n<p>It took me 3 hours by bus from my house to the college every single day, just inside the city of São Paulo (remember when I said this city is huge?).</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had the cheapest hot dog for lunch every day, because I couldn’t afford a real meal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then I would go to work (another 1h30 of bus from the college), and at night I would head back home (another bus, another 1h30). That was my routine for one and a half year throughout the college. As you can imagine, I was exhausted, and eventually getting ill.</p>\n<h3>A fork in the path</h3>\n<p>That’s when I decided that I would quit my job and start a business with my boyfriend Allyson Souza, that I met during my Graphic Design course in High School. We started the company officially in july, 2009. <a href=\"http://www.hastedesign.com.br/\">We named it Haste</a> (the portuguese word for “stem”).</p>\n<p>We were 19 years old, not much experience, zero network and money, a lot of energy, and some extra self-confidence (I could have summarized simply as “millennials”, right?). Allyson’s father gave us a computer and a part of his office, for which I am very grateful, and we created all the graphic materiais for his courses company in exchange.</p>\n<p>We started working with graphic design only, and it took us some time to realize that web development was our future.</p>\n<p>I remembered WordPress and tried it again. I liked how the platform had evolved. We made a second version of our website in WordPress, using a simple free theme, which I edited the CSS directly (oh god). We tried to create websites for clients modifying existing themes (at least we learned about child themes later), but we definitely didn’t feel in control of what we were doing.</p>\n<h3>When you hit your lowest point</h3>\n<p>In January 2011, my mother had a stroke. She had a brain surgery, and after a month, she was back home with a 6 inches scar in the head. That was the lowest point on my path.</p>\n<p>The next years I had to take care of her, because of some consequences of the stroke, both physical and psychological. As the only family member who hadn’t a “formal” job, with a boss and a defined schedule, I was the one who had to take her to appointments, or the ER, or stay home when she wasn’t ok. It was very hard to reconcile the final year of college, the work and my mom’s health care.</p>\n<h3>The only way is up</h3>\n<p>At Haste, we felt that things were not evolving. In 2013, after some partnerships that took us to some confusing paths, we decided to have a complete makeover. We defined a new focus: web design and development with WordPress. We created a new website, with a theme fully developed by us. We wanted to overcome the fear of coding, and wanted to know exactly what we were doing. So we started studying a lot by ourselves.</p>\n<p>Allyson was responsible for the PHP and JavaScript and I was supposed to make the design, the HTML and CSS. He started to ask a lot of questions in the group of WordPress Brasil community at Facebook. We finished the website, and people loved it, specially the illustration with parallax effect that made the girl move her eyes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were proud WordPress developers now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We started attending the meetups, and then the WordCamp. I was amazed how the open-source culture was all about sharing knowledge with strangers, with no fear of competition, just the spirit of collaboration. We felt no longer isolated. We made real friends (shout out to all my WordPress friends).</p>\n<p>Soon we were both involved in the community, and became WordCamp São Paulo organizers in 2014.</p>\n<p>The new website and our participation in the WordPress community were really what we needed to give us some perspective and stability. So we didn’t stop there.</p>\n<h3>Bring others to walk with you</h3>\n<p>In the 2014 edition of WordCamp São Paulo, I was the only female speaker. That made me realize a few things.</p>\n<p>First that the proportion of men in the community events was not only the majority but, we almost didn’t had any women at all, which was very weird.</p>\n<p>Second, we know that lots of girls feel intimidated in an environment with too much men. I always had a majority of male friends since I was a kid, and even so, I probably wouldn’t get involved with the community if it wasn’t by the fact that my boyfriend / partner was with me.</p>\n<p>A few sexists incidents had happened with me too. I reacted, and the men involved seemed to understand that I wasn’t ok, and changed their behavior as far as I know.</p>\n<p>We don’t have as many meetups and WordCamps here in Brazil as in US. Although Brazil is becoming a technology hub, the WordPress community has still a lot of room to grow, compared to other communities. So, I think we have the opportunity to make things different while everything is not settled yet.</p>\n<p>So I decided to act now.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I started a poll asking the women involved with WordPress the reasons why they wouldn’t attend the events. The results proved it wasn’t just me complaining about small things.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some jokes kept women away. Some condescending actions made them feel diminished. And even the lack of information from our part, that the WordCamps are inclusive events, made the women not to come. The lack of time, was an important factor too.</p>\n<p>Based on this data, the next year we managed to increase the proportion of female speakers from 5% to 32% at WordCamp São Paulo 2015. More women became organizers too. In 2019 we have 4 women out of 10 active organizers. The last WordCamp we had blind people attending, and their feedback was great. We still need to improve racial diversity though.</p>\n<h3>Barriers and frontiers</h3>\n<p>In 2015, Allyson had told me about this new scholarship program from the WordPress Foundation for women who work for equality in the community around the world. So I applied for the very first Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship. Kim Parsell left a beautiful legacy of inclusion and love, having worked to bring more women, older people, and other minorities to the WordPress community. She was known as the #WPMom.</p>\n<p>The result came few months later. I received an email, and had no reaction for a few minutes. I had won the scholarship, and it granted me a travel to WordCamp US 2015, in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, with flights and hotel covered.</p>\n<p>You see: I had never left my country. I had just took flight for the first time that same year. I was not even close to dream to go to US, because it was impossible for me at the moment. Sometimes your mindset in the only thing putting limitations in your dreams.</p>\n<p>I was so happy, you have no idea. Alx Block and Cami Kaos reached to me to give me instructions and they were very kind.</p>\n<p>But then… my visa application was denied. They considered my sudden passport and visa solicitation, with no money to travel (that’s exactly the point of a scholarship!), and lack “ties” in Brazil very suspicious. I told them that the WordPress Foundation would pay for everything. The flights and the hotel were already booked. The officer even told me that the WordPress Foundation letter could be easily forged. I tried again, with no success.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I couldn’t go to WordCamp US 2015.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I couldn’t go to WordCamp US 2016 too, when they asked if I wanted to try again, and my visa was denied&#8230; again. This time I think at least the officer searched online for me, saw it was true, but couldn’t do anything, since my situation hadn’t change.</p>\n<p>I was so disappointed. This still hurts me, I must confess. Sometimes, there are real barriers and gates that a simple mindset change cannot open.</p>\n<h3>Crossed paths</h3>\n<p>The next years, I focused on my company and the work at the community. My mom’s health improved, she’s in great shape now. My family supports my work.</p>\n<p>We became specialists in WordPress at Haste. We developed themes, plugins and sites for companies in Brazil and America. I now have a stable income and I live exclusively from my work with WordPress. We are celebrating 10 years in 2019.</p>\n<p>I traveled through Brazil because of WordPress, to speak at WordCamps and Meetups. I see more and more women working with WordPress, attending meetups and WordCamps, and talking to each other, finding something familiar in every other woman’s face.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last year we decided we would go to WordCamp Europe 2019 in Berlin, since we don’t need a visa to most countries there, including Germany.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This time I can afford it (with a lot of planning and expenses cut, but I’ll be ok). I have to confess that I’m a little anxious about the immigration process.</p>\n<p>My goal at WordCamp Europe is to know the most people I can. It’s not a matter of quantity, but if the WordPress community taught me something was that every person has something to teach and to learn. So If you are attending WordCamp Europe, let’s meet!</p>\n<h3>Opening trails</h3>\n<p>So now I hope you can see what this travel really means to me, and why every small conquest means a lot. It’s not just because it was hard. But because I’m not the only one who deserve it, but unfortunately I’m a exception between other people who have the same background as I.</p>\n<p>There are so many young girls and boys that don’t dare to dream about visiting other countries, or even getting in the college. Lots of kids that don’t have a computer, or even access to internet. The only difference is that I was given opportunities, people believed in me. Doors were opened. And just then I could prove my value.</p>\n<p>Now my next dream is to be able to make the journey a little easier than it was for me, specially for women and young Brazilians. Because I think that’s our responsibility in the community. Teach others, share information, donate some of your time, create new tools, plugins and resources, mentor people. As my brother’s tattoo says, be the person you needed when you were younger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pt-br\">Como a comunidade WordPress me ajudou a encontrar o meu caminho</h2>\n<p>Enquanto faço uma lista de todas as coisas que preciso para viajar de São Paulo para Berlim, para participar do WordCamp Europe 2019, não posso deixar de pensar no quão difícil foi o caminho até esse ponto.</p>\n<p>Para algumas pessoas, uma viagem como essa pode parecer comum, mas, para mim, esse será o mais longe que já fui até agora, de muitas maneiras. Especialmente porque, da última vez que eu planejava participar de um WordCamp internacional, as coisas não deram certo.</p>\n<p>Então deixe-me contar sobre esse caminho.</p>\n<h3>Os primeiros passos</h3>\n<p>Eu nasci e cresci em São Paulo. Permita-me dar um pouco de contexto sobre minha cidade. São Paulo é a mais rica e maior cidade do Brasil. Com mais de 14 milhões de pessoas, é também a maior cidade do hemisfério sul. É maior que Nova York.</p>\n<p>Como toda grande cidade, São Paulo é um lugar de oportunidades, mas também de contrastes.</p>\n<p>Crescendo, apesar de sermos pobres, minha família se importava muito com a minha educação e do meu irmão mais novo. Meu pai, que sempre gostou de tecnologia, conseguiu um computador para nós em 1996. Naquela época, eu tinha 6 anos, e éramos a única família das redondezas a ter um computador por um longo tempo, e isso era triste. Essa exposição precoce à tecnologia fez uma grande diferença na minha vida.</p>\n<p>Aos 13 anos, eu já estava interessada em design gráfico e programação. Nós tínhamos aquela internet discada muito limitada e cara, que só era gratuita depois da meia-noite e nos fins de semana. Então, para aprender essas habilidades, minhas melhores opções eram as revistas em CD-ROM que meu pai trazia para casa. Eu também aprendi sobre HTML com um livro sobre o Microsoft Front Page. Aos 14 anos, vendi meu primeiro site, inteiramente criado no Front Page, com muitos GIFs e tags &lt;marquee&gt;, para uma vizinha que precisava para um projeto da faculdade. Ela adorou!</p>\n<p>Eu decidi que queria trabalhar com design. Então fiz o curso técnico em design gráfico durante o ensino médio. Com o meu interesse pelo web design, tudo o que eu queria era ter um site que estivesse online. Eu não podia pagar um servidor, mas felizmente, neste momento, os blogs se tornaram muito populares aqui no Brasil.</p>\n<p>Procurei uma plataforma para criar um portfólio. Eu brinquei um pouco com uma plataforma chamada WordPress (você pode ter ouvido falar dela) mas acabei usando o Blogger, porque havia a possibilidade de personalizar o CSS do tema online. Eu fiz um tema escuro e grunge para o meu blog que ainda está online.</p>\n<h3>Uma estrada esburacada</h3>\n<p>Consegui uma bolsa de Design Gráfico em uma boa faculdade em São Paulo, mas ainda teria que pagar metade da mensalidade. O problema era que minha família definitivamente não tinha como arcar com isso. Meus pais disseram que cortariam algumas despesas e me ajudariam, mas eu sabia que não havia nada que pudessem cortar. Então eu disse a eles para não se preocuparem, eu encontraria um emprego.</p>\n<p>Neste momento, eu havia feito um trabalho freelancer criando um site HTML (no Dreamweaver desta vez). Com exatamente 1 mês para o aplicativo da faculdade, esta cliente propôs que eu começasse a trabalhar lá para manter o site que tinha acabado de criar. Então eu pude pagar pela faculdade (bem mal). Depois de seis meses, solicitei uma bolsa de estudos integral e ela foi concedida. As coisas melhoraram um pouco financeiramente, mas o caminho ainda era rochoso.</p>\n<p>Levava 3 horas de ônibus da minha casa para a faculdade todos os dias, apenas dentro da cidade de São Paulo (lembra quando eu disse que essa cidade é enorme?). Eu comia um cachorro-quente mais barato para o almoço todos os dias, porque eu não podia pagar uma refeição de verdade. Então eu ia trabalhar (outra 1h30 de ônibus da faculdade), e à noite eu voltava para casa (outro ônibus, outro 1h30). Essa foi a minha rotina por um ano e meio durante a faculdade. Como você pode imaginar, eu estava exausta e ficando doente.</p>\n<h3>Uma bifurcação no caminho</h3>\n<p>Foi então que decidi largar meu trabalho e começar um negócio com meu namorado Allyson Souza, que conheci durante o curso de Design Gráfico no Ensino Médio. Nós começamos a empresa oficialmente em julho de 2009. Nós a nomeamos Haste.</p>\n<p>Nós tínhamos 19 anos de idade, não muita experiência, zero networking e dinheiro, muita energia e alguma autoconfiança extra (eu poderia ter resumido simplesmente como “millennials”, certo?). O pai do Allyson nos deu um computador e uma parte de seu escritório, pelo que sou muito grata, e criamos todos os materiais gráficos para sua empresa de cursos em troca.</p>\n<p>Começamos a trabalhar apenas com design gráfico e levamos algum tempo para perceber que o desenvolvimento web era o nosso futuro.</p>\n<p>Lembrei-me do WordPress e tentei novamente. Eu gostei de como a plataforma evoluiu. Fizemos uma segunda versão do nosso site no WordPress, usando um simples tema gratuito, que eu editei diretamente o CSS (não façam isso!). Tentamos criar websites para clientes que modificando temas existentes (pelo menos aprendemos sobre temas filhos mais tarde), mas definitivamente não nos sentíamos no controle do que estávamos fazendo.</p>\n<h3>Quando você atinge seu ponto mais baixo</h3>\n<p>Em janeiro de 2011, minha mãe teve um AVC. Ela fez uma cirurgia no cérebro, e depois de um mês, ela estava em casa com uma cicatriz na cabeça. Esse foi o ponto mais baixo do meu caminho.</p>\n<p>Nos anos seguintes eu tive que cuidar dela, por causa de algumas consequências do AVC, tanto físicas quanto psicológicas. Como a única pessoa da família que não tinha um emprego “formal”, com um chefe e um horário de trabalho definido, fui eu quem teve que levá-la às consultas, ao pronto-socorro ou ficar em casa quando ela não estava bem. Foi bem difícil conciliar o último ano da faculdade, o trabalho e cuidar da saúde da minha mãe.</p>\n<h3>O único caminho é para cima</h3>\n<p>Na Haste, sentimos que as coisas não estavam evoluindo. Em 2013, após algumas parcerias que nos levaram a caminhos confusos, decidimos fazer uma reformulação completa. Definimos um novo foco: web design e desenvolvimento com WordPress. Criamos um novo site, com um tema totalmente desenvolvido por nós. Queríamos superar o medo de programar e queríamos saber exatamente o que estávamos fazendo. Então começamos a estudar muito por conta própria.</p>\n<p>Allyson ficou responsável pelo PHP e JavaScript e eu deveria fazer o design, o HTML e CSS. Ele começou a postar muitas perguntas no grupo da comunidade WordPress Brasil no Facebook. Nós terminamos o site, e as pessoas adoraram, especialmente a ilustração com efeito de paralaxe que fez a garota mover seus olhos. Nós éramos orgulhosos desenvolvedores do WordPress agora.</p>\n<p>Nós começamos a frequentar os meetups, e depois o WordCamp da comunidade WordPress. Fiquei espantada com a forma como a cultura de código aberto era toda sobre compartilhar conhecimento com estranhos, sem medo de competir, apenas o espírito de colaboração. Não nos sentíamos mais isolados. Nós fizemos amigos de verdade (alô amigos do WordPress).</p>\n<p>Logo nos envolvemos na comunidade e nos tornamos organizadores do WordCamp São Paulo em 2014.</p>\n<p>O novo site e nossa participação na comunidade WordPress foram realmente o que precisávamos para nos dar alguma perspectiva e estabilidade. Então nós não paramos por aí.</p>\n<h3>Traga os outros para caminhar com você</h3>\n<p>Na edição de 2014 do WordCamp São Paulo, eu era a única palestrante mulher. Isso me fez perceber algumas coisas.</p>\n<p>Primeiro, a proporção de homens nos eventos da comunidade não era apenas a maioria, mas quase não tínhamos nenhuma mulher. O que era muito estranho.</p>\n<p>Em segundo lugar, sabemos que muitas mulheres se sentem intimidadas em um ambiente com muitos homens. Eu sempre tive a maioria de amigos homens desde criança, e mesmo assim, eu provavelmente não me envolveria com a comunidade se não fosse pelo fato de meu namorado / sócio estar comigo.</p>\n<p>Alguns incidentes sexistas também aconteceram comigo. Eu reagi, e os homens envolvidos parecem ter entendido o problema, e mudaram seus comportamentos até onde eu sei.</p>\n<p>Não temos tantos meetups e WordCamps aqui no Brasil como nos EUA. Embora o Brasil esteja lentamente se tornando um polo de tecnologia, a comunidade WordPress ainda tem muito espaço para crescer, em comparação com outras comunidades. Então, acho que temos a oportunidade de fazer as coisas diferentes enquanto tudo ainda não está definido.</p>\n<p>Então eu decidi mudar isso.</p>\n<p>Eu comecei uma pesquisa perguntando às mulheres envolvidas com WordPress quais eram as razões pelas quais elas não compareciam aos eventos. Os resultados provaram que não era só eu reclamando de pequenas coisas.</p>\n<p>Algumas piadas mantinham as mulheres afastadas. Algumas ações condescendentes fizeram com que se sentissem diminuídas. E mesmo a falta de informação de nossa parte, de que os WordCamps são eventos inclusivos, fez com que as mulheres não viessem. A falta de tempo também foi um fator importante.</p>\n<p>Com base nesses dados, no ano seguinte conseguimos aumentar a proporção de mulheres palestrantes de 5% para 32% no WordCamp São Paulo 2015. Mais mulheres se tornaram organizadoras também. Em 2019, temos 4 mulheres de 10 organizadores ativos. No último WordCamp, tivemos deficientes visuais comparecendo e o feedback deles foi ótimo. Ainda precisamos melhorar a diversidade racial.</p>\n<h3>Barreiras e fronteiras</h3>\n<p>Em 2015, Allyson me contou sobre o novo programa de bolsas de estudos da Fundação WordPress para mulheres que trabalham pela igualdade na comunidade em todo o mundo. Então me inscrevi para a primeira bolsa Kim Parsell Memorial. Kim Parsell deixou um lindo legado de inclusão e amor, tendo trabalhado para trazer mais mulheres, pessoas mais velhas e outras minorias para a comunidade WordPress. Ela era conhecida como a #WPMom.</p>\n<p>O resultado veio alguns meses depois. Recebi um email e não tive reação por alguns minutos. Eu tinha ganhado a bolsa que me garantia uma viagem para o WordCamp US 2015, na Filadélfia, na Pensilvânia, com voos e hotel cobertos.</p>\n<p>Veja bem: eu nunca tinha saído do meu país. Eu tinha acabado de voar de avião pela primeira vez naquele mesmo ano. Eu não estava nem perto de sonhar em ir para os EUA, porque era impossível para mim no momento. Às vezes sua mentalidade na única coisa colocando limitações em seus sonhos.</p>\n<p>Eu estava tão feliz, você não faz ideia. Alx Block e Cami Kaos entraram em contato para me dar instruções e foram muito gentis.</p>\n<p>Mas então&#8230; meu pedido de visto foi negado. Eles consideraram minha solicitação repentina de passaporte e visto, sem dinheiro para viajar (esse é exatamente o ponto de uma bolsa de estudos!),  e a falta de “laços” no Brasil muito suspeitos. Eu disse a eles que a Fundação WordPress pagaria por tudo. Os voos e o hotel já estavam reservados. O oficial até me disse que a carta da Fundação WordPress poderia ser facilmente falsificada. Eu tentei de novo, sem sucesso.</p>\n<p>Eu não pude ir para o WordCamp US 2015.</p>\n<p>Eu também não pude ir ao WordCamp US 2016, quando eles perguntaram se eu queria tentar novamente, e meu visto foi negado&#8230; de novo. Desta vez, acho que pelo menos o oficial pesquisou on-line por mim, viu que era verdade, mas não conseguiu fazer nada, pois minha situação não mudara.</p>\n<p>Eu estava tão desapontada. Ainda fico triste de lembrar, devo confessar. Às vezes, existem barreiras e portões reais que uma simples mudança de mentalidade não pode abrir.</p>\n<h3>Caminhos cruzados</h3>\n<p>Nos anos seguintes, concentrei-me em minha empresa e no trabalho na comunidade. A saúde da minha mãe melhorou, ela está em ótima agora. Minha família apóia meu trabalho.</p>\n<p>Nós nos tornamos especialistas em WordPress na Haste. Desenvolvemos temas, plugins e sites para empresas no Brasil e na América. Agora tenho uma renda estável e vivo exclusivamente do meu trabalho com o WordPress. Estamos comemorando 10 anos em 2019.</p>\n<p>Eu viajei pelo Brasil por causa do WordPress, para falar em WordCamps e Meetups. Fui para Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Porto Alegre. Eu vejo mais e mais mulheres trabalhando com o WordPress, participando de meetups e WordCamps, e conversando, encontrando algo familiar no rosto das outras mulheres.</p>\n<p>No ano passado, decidimos que iríamos para o WordCamp Europa 2019 em Berlim, já que não precisamos de visto para a maioria dos países, incluindo a Alemanha.</p>\n<p>Desta vez, posso pagar (com muito planejamento e redução de despesas). Tenho que confessar que estou um pouco ansiosa com o processo de imigração.</p>\n<p>Meu objetivo no WordCamp Europa é conhecer o máximo de pessoas que posso. Não é uma questão de quantidade, mas se a comunidade do WordPress me ensinou algo foi que cada pessoa tem algo para ensinar e aprender. Então, se você estiver participando do WordCamp Europa, vamos nos conhecer!</p>\n<h3>Abrindo trilhas</h3>\n<p>Então agora eu espero que você possa ver o que essa viagem realmente significa para mim, e porque cada pequena conquista significa muito. Não é só porque foi difícil. Mas porque eu não sou a única que merece isso, mas infelizmente sou uma exceção entre outras pessoas que têm o mesmo histórico que eu.</p>\n<p>Há tantas meninas e meninos que não se atrevem a sonhar em visitar outros países ou até mesmo entrar na faculdade. E quando se atrevem, tem seus sonhos podados. Muitas crianças que não têm computador nem acesso à internet. A única diferença é que me foram dadas oportunidades, as pessoas acreditaram em mim. Portas foram abertas. E só então eu pude provar o meu valor.</p>\n<p>Agora meu próximo sonho é poder tornar a jornada um pouco mais fácil do que foi para mim, especialmente para mulheres e jovens brasileiros. Porque acho que é nossa responsabilidade na comunidade. Ensine outras pessoas, compartilhe informações, doe um pouco do seu tempo, crie novas ferramentas, plugins e recursos, oriente as pessoas. Como diz a tatuagem do meu irmão, seja a pessoa de que você precisava quando era mais jovem.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=How%20the%20WordPress%20community%20helped%20me%20find%20my%20way&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fhow-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fhow-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fhow-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way%2F&title=How+the+WordPress+community+helped+me+find+my+way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042419-min-150x150.jpg&description=How the WordPress community helped me find my way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/\" title=\"How the WordPress community helped me find my way\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/\">How the WordPress community helped me find my way</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 12:00:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Anyssa Ferreira\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: Henry Zhu Launches New Maintainers Anonymous Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/henry-zhu-launches-new-maintainers-anonymous-podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3117:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.maintainersanonymous.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Maintainers Anonymous</a> is a new podcast created by <a href=\"https://www.henryzoo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Zhu</a>, who has been the primary maintainer of <a href=\"https://github.com/babel/babel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Babel</a> for the past two years. Babel is a JavaScript compiler used by Facebook, Netflix, Spotify, and millions of others.

By presenting them as regular people, rather than faceless code projects, Zhu is aiming to encourage empathy for maintainers.</p>\n<p>Maintainers Anonymous is centered around the &#8220;how&#8221; of maintenance and Zhu is open to having guests from a variety of fields and disciplines, such as a librarian, gardener, or moderator. In an episode titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.maintainersanonymous.com/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Speedrunning with Omnigamer</a>,&#8221; Zhu and his first guest, Eric Koziel, discuss the intricacies of &#8220;speedrunning,&#8221; playing a video game with the goal of beating it as fast as possible. Koziel describes it as a medium for doing an optimization challenge. Since the games are just software, he and Zhu explored how speedrunning intersects with coding and talked about some of the parallels with maintaining open source software.</p>\n<p>The next two episodes are a series with guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sehurlburt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stephanie Hurlburt</a>, a graphics engineer and owner of the company that makes <a href=\"http://www.binomial.info/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Basis</a>, an image/texture compression product.

It includes CSS tree shaking improvements that restore AMP compatibility for WordPress&#8217; default Twenty Nineteen theme, reducing the size of its stylesheet by 53%.</p>\n<p>In an effort to get more users opting for the Native mode option, the plugin&#8217;s development team has rebranded the template modes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In this release the Paired mode has been rebranded as Transitional mode. One reason for this is that the classic mode was also a paired mode (where there are separate parallel URLs for the AMP version). But more importantly, the goal for this mode is to help facilitate a transition a site to being AMP-first, where there is no separate AMP-specific URLs. So the goal of the Transitional mode is to be a path to Native mode.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team has also decided to <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/pull/2034\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rebrand Classic mode to “Reader” mode</a>, instead of deprecating it. It provides a basic AMP template for getting started that doesn&#8217;t necessarily match the site&#8217;s theme. Users can can add an “Exit Reader Mode” to the header of their sites with a setting in the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Version 1.1 introduces compatibility with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pwa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PWA feature plugin</a>, bringing support for the service worker to AMP pages. It extends the service worker to cache AMP CDN assets, images, and Google Fonts. Since the PWA feature plugin is still under active development, the service worker integration is still considered experimental.</p>\n<p>Support for creating AMP Stories in WordPress is the next major feature coming to the plugin. A pre-release of the <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/wiki/AMP-Stories-Experimental\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMP Stories editor</a> is available in <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/releases/tag/1.2-alpha1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1.2 alpha 1</a>, which also requires the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin. It uses the Gutenberg editor to allow users to build AMP stories with rich media capabilities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/ctuGgKap-qE\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/CmLLaYT1Yy.gif?resize=627%2C353&ssl=1\" alt=\"Amp stories\" width=\"627\" height=\"353\" /></a></p>\n<p>A preview of the AMP Stories editor was unveiled at <a href=\"https://amp.dev/events/amp-conf-2019\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMP Conf 2019</a> in Tokyo, Japan.

In the past three years, Rich founded <a href=\"http://layup.media/\">a digital agency</a>, launched a popular PhotoShop <a href=\"https://purtypixels.com/\">resource site</a>, and started <a href=\"https://themebeans.com/\">ThemeBeans</a>, a successful WordPress theme shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ThemeBeans and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\">CoBlocks</a>, Rich&#8217;s suite of page builder blocks in a plugin, have gone with him to Godaddy. (CoBlocks remains free, and now all the ThemeBeans products are too.)  Rich took some time to reflect with us on his path so far and where he sees the WordPress ecosystem going in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What led you to dive into the new post-Gutenberg reality of WordPress and create CoBlocks and Block Gallery? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been fascinated by the block editor ever since Matias’s Gutenberg demo during WordCamp US 2017. I was instantly convinced that Gutenberg would lead us into the next era of creation in WordPress. I saw an opportunity, was in a position to execute and had enough expertise to take it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Did sales for these products meet your expectations?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually did not release paid versions for either CoBlocks or Block Gallery. There were plans to monetize both plugins, but at the time we were focused on delivering innovative solutions to Gutenberg and pushing the editor to its extremes. Adoption-wise, both plugins grew particularly fast, and are continuing to do so. In that sense, they most certainly exceeded my expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What do you see as the near and long term future of the WordPress ecosystem? As solo developers and small firms are increasingly hired by bigger fish, especially hosting companies, will there still be a place for small entrepreneurs? </strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that the WordPress ecosystem will continue to be an innovative field for both entrepreneurs and larger companies. It’s all about innovation and being able to execute —  regardless of the size of the team behind the product or idea. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And over the last few years, the WordPress economy and its entrepreneurial leaders, have evolved into quite a mature ecosystem. I’d say the fact that companies such as GoDaddy are investing in the future of WordPress is a huge sign of that maturity and growth in our industry. Hosts, in particular, are uniquely equipped to make a huge difference in how so many folks use WordPress. Investing in products and talent that level-up the overall WordPress experience is good for us all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What about GoDaddy made it seem like a good fit or you? Did you consider any other types of companies outside the hosting space?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I flew out to Phoenix to meet the WordPress leadership team at GoDaddy and it became quite clear that they were all-in on this new future of WordPress + Gutenberg.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy has assembled a passionate and highly qualified team of folks who are hyper-focused on improving the WordPress experience and leading the next wave of innovation in this space. Joining this team and leading the efforts as the Senior Product Manager of WordPress Experience is a good and logical fit to fulfilling my personal mission to help make WordPress beautifully simpler. I knew that what we’d build would touch millions of sites and empower people all over the world to succeed online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Before GoDaddy came along, what was your plan in terms of growth and long-term sustainability?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having run a successful theme shop for a number of years, I understood the importance of having a solid plan for growth and sustainability. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My plan for both CoBlocks and Block Gallery was to release top-tiered paid versions of each, with innovative tools, blocks and design systems. Those would have likely arrived in Q3 of 2019, as our focus for the first half of the year was to innovate and grow our user base. Now I hope to continue on that same development trajectory, adding many of those same features to the current plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What is your best advice for someone who is currently independent and wants to build a small business in the WordPress space today? What are the best lessons or advice you can provide?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, don’t let an opportunity get away from you. Learn to identify opportunities that you are perfectly suited to execute on, then dive right in. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for help and don’t be afraid to try something new. Learning how to learn and then taking that a step further by continuing to learn every single day, is a catalyst for enormous personal and professional growth. It’s not all about making cool stuff, it’s about challenging yourself to become the best version of yourself; the rest will fall into place. &nbsp;<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 21:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2 Will Add 13 New Icons to the Dashicon Library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88937\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-will-add-13-new-icons-to-the-dashicon-library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2848:\"<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dashicons</a>, the WordPress admin icon font, will be getting its first <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> in three years when WordPress 5.2 ships.

I was working on a project for a woman&#8217;s rights organization that needed a &#8216;staff&#8217; post type. It was a little awkward explaining to them that there was a &#8216;businessman&#8217; icon we could use for free, or they could pay extra to have a custom &#8216;businesswoman&#8217; icon designed. Not a great look for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Allen submitted a GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/issues/285\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a>, to see if someone would be willing to create a &#8220;businesswoman&#8221; and &#8220;businessperson&#8221; icon, but nobody had the time. Dashicons is maintained by a volunteer team and it can take a long time to get new icons designed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;About 5-6 months later I learned how to use Illustrator to create vector icons and submitted the icons myself,&#8221; Allen said. He <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/pull/323\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">submitted the PR</a> and the new icons he created will be included in the next release of WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/business-people-icons.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>These business people icons are useful for projects that include creating things like custom post types for bios, testimonials, team members, and job postings.

It was <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/14898\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">renamed</a> to avoid confusion with the HTML5 section element and prevent potential overlap with future site/theme type sections, such as headers, sidebars, and footers. The first iteration of the Group block supports the ability to nest other blocks inside it and the ability to align the block and any of its child blocks that include alignment settings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-17-at-12.41.22-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a minimal version at the moment and improvements about the flows to add inner blocks, group/ungroup blocks are expected in follow-up releases,&#8221; Gutenberg phase 2 technical lead Riad Benguella said. In testing the feature I found that it is indeed a rocky start and far from intuitive to use but a more refined grouping experience will be developed after further testing and feedback.</p>\n<p>The Group block lays the foundation for a future where WordPress themes may evolve to become block templates. In response to a comment about how the Group block could essentially replace the widget management interface, Benguella offered a glimpse of how Gutenberg will eventually transform the theme industry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a world where themes are made of block templates instead of php templates, there’s no need for widget areas.</p>\n<p>That said, Gutenberg is a huge change for WordPress and its community. With the new blocks concept, Phase 2 is about helping the WordPress community adopt this new concept without completely changing what a theme means in WordPress. We shouldn’t just abandon existing themes and switch into full-site editing without an iterative plan.</p>\n<p>We’ll eventually get there where everything is made of block templates and blocks but we need to make smaller steps first and the first one is the ability to use blocks instead of widgets in existing themes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.5 also adds the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14445\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">image fill option</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13989\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vertical alignment</a> support to the Media and Text blocks. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/media-text-vertical-align-small-1.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also includes a few minor but useful improvements, such as automatically populating the link field when the selected text is an email.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/email-linked.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team is also making progress on the new widgets screen with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14612\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">barebones testing version</a> in place that will allow them to start investigating and tackling technical issues related to this screen. It&#8217;s not functional yet but provides a place to further explore the block editor in this context.</p>\n<p>The bug fixes included in Gutenberg 5.5 will be in the upcoming WordPress 5.2 release, which was previously targeted for April 30.

Till now I was living my life with my own surroundings, now it will be no more that much of hidden.</p>\n<p>I am a very simple person from Kolkata, India. I started my career with IBM ACE i.e an IBM education wing, as a Technical Teacher. I used to teach my students several subjects like C,C++, Perl and PHP. Although I was teaching many subjects my focus was in PHP starting from 2003. In the early days of 2009 I came to know about WordPress. From the first few days I was struggling with the Administrative panel and other services.</p>\n<p>In 2009 end I decided to step down from my job and started differently. I started development work and also continue teaching the students.</p>\n<p>I was decided to develop the websites and web applications with the WordPress only, and I got the version called `Carmen` 2.9 which was a relief for me to handle the CMS. I got some help from my students and friends who were engaged in WordPress development at that time. They teach me how I can handle the WordPress more proficient way. I learnt how to develop WordPress themes, started developing the plugins.</p>\n<h3>Working with WordPress</h3>\n<p>I started developing the website using WordPress from 2010 onwards. Later on 2014 I started developing WordPress theme for the Themeforest Market place. I also started developing the plugins which helps my development process to run smoothly.</p>\n<h3>How it changed My life</h3>\n<p>My life started changing from 2010 when I started developing with WordPress. The instability of my life was changed into a stable life, which was beyond my expectation. I was living a good life with my family. What else I can expect from WordPress.</p>\n<h3>What’s Different</h3>\n<p>Apart from developing the Websites and other application, I started my research on how the development process can be more smoother and flexible. I started working on WP CLI to developing the automated process for WordPress. I developed a script that helps developers to install the WordPress flawlessly using WP CLI. My linux knowledge also helped me to write shell scripts. The script can be found in my account at github. I am also trying to get into the easy deployment process with CI/CD for the developers using Bitbucket Pipeline and AWS.</p>\n<p>I slowly become an expert on the theme approval guidelines of Themeforest Market place. Apart from that I started writing blogs on the various topics related to WordPress. Achieved almost 3K reputation in StackOverflow. Developed Plugins in wordpress.org.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>Even though I was developed many plugins and theme I never thought of uploading that in wordpress.org. I start realizing that to help many more people in WordPress, wordpress.org will be a better place than StackOverflow.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Kolkata</h3>\n<p>I joined Kolkata WordPress Community who was planning the WordCamp Kolkata, and thankfully they have selected me as a volunteer. Mr Subrata Sarkar( WordPress Core Contributor ) and the team who recognized me and give a huge responsibilities in WordCamp Kolkata 2019. It was again a tremendous experiences with WordPress. Since that was my first WordCamp I tried to fulfill my responsibilities. Become a Volunteer I learnt to be more polite and more decent to the people, make many more friends from different regions and countries.</p>\n<h3>My Inspirations</h3>\n<p>There are many people who inspired and helped me during my journey, its small tribute to them by mentioning a few : Abhik Goswami, Sneh Sagar Prajapati, Prabhas Chowdhury, Debobrata Debnath, Prosenjit Manna, Sk. Shamim Ullah, Soumit Pal, Subrata Sarkar.</p>\n<h3>My Words</h3>\n<p>Be polite to others. Be friendly to your Juniors and fellow developers. Try to teach them rather pointing to the mistakes. Attend Meetups. Contribute to the Community. Think what new you have done, and what new can be.</p>\n<p>Stay healthy, stay fit with WordPress <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"bangla\">WordPress এবং স্থিতিশীলতা, বাংলা তে পড়ুন</h2>\n<p>WordPress র সাথে পরিচয় ২০০৯ এর December এ, শুরু থেকেই ভালো লাগা.
